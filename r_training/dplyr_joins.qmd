## Session outline

This session is an ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ **intermediate practical** designed for those with some R experience. The aim of this session is to do three things with dplyr:

+ explain the difference between binds and joins
+ to demonstrate a range of different joining strategies
+ to look at dplyr's tools for controlling joins
