## Session outline

This session is an ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ **intermediate practical** designed for those with some R experience. The aim of this session is to do three things with dplyr:

+ explain the difference between binds and joins
+ to demonstrate a range of different joining strategies
+ to explain dplyr's new tools for controlling joins (`.by`, `by()`, `multiple()`, `unmatched()`)

You might also like some of the other dplyr-themed practical sessions:

* [Summarising data with dplyr](dplyr_group_summarise.qmd)
* [Tidyselect](tidyselect.qmd)
