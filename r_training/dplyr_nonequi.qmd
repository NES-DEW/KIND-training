## Session outline

This session is an ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ **intermediate practical** designed for those with some R experience. The aim of this session is to do three things with dplyr:

* to understand non-equi joins
* to see where non-equi joins might be useful
* to understand dplyr's tools for non-equi joins: (`.by`, `by()`, `multiple()`, `unmatched()`)

You should have a good understanding of standardard joins (and binds) using dplyr before this session: [dplyr joins](dplyr_joins.qmd)
