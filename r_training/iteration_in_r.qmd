## Session outline

This session is an ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ **intermediate practical** designed for those with some R experience. The aim of this session is to explore iteration in R. That has several strands, including:

+ understanding the basics of iterating
+ using multiple layers of loops
+ collecting the output of loops
+ understanding when loops work well, and when they're better avoided
