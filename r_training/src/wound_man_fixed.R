seq(0, 1, by=0.1)[3] == round(1740/600,0) - 2.8 # THREE FIXES HERE:
## f14 == to check for equality, rather than =, and making sure about 1-indexing
## f15, the inequality here is expected behaviour owing to floating point errors. There are lots of ways of representing decimal numbers in use in R, but they all give subtly different results. These differences usually don't matter to us, but they do make the exacting == fall over. all.equal(0.2, 0.2) is less exacting
