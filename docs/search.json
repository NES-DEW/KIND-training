Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I've read: Tom Lean's Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn't do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries.\"\n\nbotw[5,] |&gt;\n  select(Author, Year) # subsetting by index and columns and returning a tibble\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Author   Year \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Tom Lean 2016 \n\nbotw |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt; 2010) |&gt;\n  arrange(Year) #

For example, you’ll nearly always supply the web address of your image:\n\n&lt;img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OpmMr44.jpg\"&gt; \nYou can also resize the image using HTML, by adding height/width info to the tag:\n&lt;img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OpmMr44.jpg\" height=\"300\"&gt; \nAnd you can play with the alignment, padding, etc etc:\n&lt;img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OpmMr44.jpg\" height=\"300\" ALIGN=\"left\" HSPACE=\"15\" VSPACE=\"25\"/&gt;\n\n(this goes a bit wonky in the quarto we use to build the training pages - definitely worth trying out yourself in your HTML file)  ## Tables\nTables are built by using several tags in concert.

A remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was said for the well being and full recovery of the intervention group.\nMain outcome measures: Mortality in hospital, length of stay in hospital, and duration of fever.\nResults: Mortality was 28.1% (475/1691) in the intervention group and 30.2% (514/1702) in the control group (P for difference=0.4). Length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively).\n\n\nThese results, however, need to be interpreted with caution. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the most clinically important outcome (mortality), and the median values varied little between prayer and non-prayer on both length of stay (seven and eight days) and duration of fever (two days each). The religious affiliation of the person saying the prayer is not given. Many religious groups do not accept the power of prayer given by those with different beliefs. If real, the effect of prayer shown in this study may be unrelated to supernatural power and hence to a particular belief system, or may be specific to beliefs, reflecting the power inherent in a particular religion. Further work is needed in this area before conclusions can be made. (Thornett 2002)"

And that’s a cause for serious concern: all free text will definitely need some kind of tidy-up at the analysis stage. It’s hard not to favour your favourites there, and it took me a while to realise that e.g. we had “Grays Anatomy” and “Gray’s Anatomy” in our data. To avoid that sort of bias, I’d be keen to try and pre-designate what text fixing you’re planning to do before you collect the data (so all lower-case without punctuation, and with manual tidying-up of spelling, for example)."
