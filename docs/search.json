A remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was said for the well being and full recovery of the intervention group.\nMain outcome measures: Mortality in hospital, length of stay in hospital, and duration of fever.\nResults: Mortality was 28.1% (475/1691) in the intervention group and 30.2% (514/1702) in the control group (P for difference=0.4). Length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively).\n\n\nThese results, however, need to be interpreted with caution. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the most clinically important outcome (mortality), and the median values varied little between prayer and non-prayer on both length of stay (seven and eight days) and duration of fever (two days each). The religious affiliation of the person saying the prayer is not given. Many religious groups do not accept the power of prayer given by those with different beliefs. If real, the effect of prayer shown in this study may be unrelated to supernatural power and hence to a particular belief system, or may be specific to beliefs, reflecting the power inherent in a particular religion. Further work is needed in this area before conclusions can be made. (Thornett 2002)"

Regular expressions are a way of matching all kinds of strings by specifying a pattern. For example, you can use regex to search through a piece of text for all the email addresses that it contains. In pseudocode, the regex would work like this:\n\nlook for an @\nlook for the start and ends of the word that contains that @\nmake sure that the word doesn’t contain any forbidden characters\n\nGetting to grips with regex is a bit forbidding, because the syntax used is very concise and impenetrable. For instance, the above pseudocode translates into:\n\n[[:alnum:].-_]+@[[:alnum:].-]+\n\nLuckily, there are some great tools to help the beginner - such as the Rstudio cheatsheet, or the interactive tool regular expressions 101.

    "text": "This is an introduction to stringdist which is designed to allow fuzzy matching of text. Install and attach in the standard way:\n\n# install.packages(\"stringdist\") # likely needs compiling\nlibrary(stringdist) \nlibrary(ggplot2) # for something fun later\n\nWhile there are several families of functions in the package, we’ll concentrate on those that focus on the core idea: strings differ, and you can quantify those differences for pleasure and profit. A simple example:\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"think\")\n\n[1] 1\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"string\")\n\n[1] 2\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"oxpecker\")\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nOnce you’ve got an idea about how different you’re okay with your strings being, you can use e.g. a max distance as a cut-off to do work in your code.

Start with labelling, where there are several different possible options:\n\npeng_plot +\n  ggtitle(\"A title using ggtitle\") # good if you're only adding a title\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n  xlab(\"Bill length (mm), set using xlab\") # or if you just want to tweak the x-axis label\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n  labs(x = \"Bill length (mm), set using labs\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n    labs(title = \"An uninformative title\") # better if you're doing lots of labelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n    labs(title = \"An uninformative title\",\n       x = \"Something about Bill Lengths\",\n       subtitle = \"This one here is a subtitle\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also theme the entire plot:\n\npeng_plot +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach element can be styled individually. That can become very involved, but some simple and useful examples:\n\npeng_plot +\n  theme_classic(base_size = 18) # embiggen the text\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") # hide the legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising the plot colours can be done in several ways. For very simple cases, it might be enough to specify a vector of colour names or hex values, which you can then use inside either scale_fill_manual or scale_colour_manual:\n\nmy_colours &lt;- c(\"#e66101\", \"#b2abd2\", \"#5e3c99\")\n\npeng_plot +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = my_colours) # use scale_colour_manual for geoms that take a colour aesthetic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# if you're using a geom that takes a fill, use scale_fill_manual:\n\npenguins |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, fill = species)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = my_colours)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually specifying colours is hard, particularly as you should be considering the likely impacts on accessibility that can result. A stronger general approach is to use colorbrewer to do the hard work for you:\n\npeng_plot +\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeng_plot +\n  scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Paired\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also borrow entire themes from packages, such as ggthemes:\n\n# install.packages(\"ggthemes\")\nlibrary(ggthemes)\npeng_plot +\n  theme_economist() +\n  scale_colour_economist()"

You can think of this similar to the process of drafting, and then editing, and then proof-reading text. There’s lots to say about this subject, so we’ll stick to a few beginner tips here. But you might also like to look at the set of R community standards produced by the KIND network:\nUse source()\n\nsource() allows you to split up long R scripts. If you put some code in a file called somescript.R, you can then include that code in another script by writing: source(somescript.R). It’s as if you’d pasted the code in, but without the bulk and confusion that can cause.\nPick a structure and stick to it\nFor example, you might go with something like:\n\nscript information at the very top\nthen package loading\nthen data loading\nthen function definitions\n…\nMake your variable names sensible (and hierarchical)\nSo if you’re working with a set of data about GP practices named practices, you might create several derivative variables which would most sensibly be named:\n\npractices_count\npractices_count_grouped\npractices_largest\n…\nAdd comments and sections\n\n# all the code here has been full of comments.

    "text": "Use projects\nYou should work in projects. That’s easy to do in Posit Cloud as everything is a project. R projects help keep you organised, and prevent you having to do lots of messy and fallible work in setting working directories, supplying file paths, and wrestling with scripts when you move them.\nR thinks about a working directory, which is where it is based at the time it’s running. You can use the getwd() and setwd() to find out, or change, your working directory. But those are better avoided. If you’re working in a project, the project root is your working directory.\nProjects allow you to use relative paths with confidence - so \"data/data.csv\" describes a file named data.csv that lives in the data subdirectory of your project. Managing full paths is a nuisance in R, especially if you’re on Windows. R doesn’t like Windows file paths as they include back slashes \\. For example:C:\\my_drive\\my_code\\R_code\\data\\data.csv. If we want to use that path in R, you’ll need to tweak it to deal with the back slashes. You can either double them:C:\\\\my_drive\\\\my_code\\\\R_code\\\\data\\\\data.csv or replace them with forward slashes /: C:/my_drive/my_code/R_code/data/data.csv.\nBut definitely better to avoid full paths if at all possible. Projects make scripts portable by allowing you to ignore details specific to your computer that are hard-coded into paths etc etc. Sharing code is a key advantage of R, and you should make that as easy and fun as possible"

A nice example is when your console is showing an +, rather than a &gt;, which means means that R is waiting for input, and usually means there’s a missing bracket somewhere.\nAnother one to watch out for: there are a couple of different filter functions. If a filter isn’t working well, it’s always worth specifying which filter you want with dplyr::filter (or much more rarely stats::filter),"

A good place to start would be the openxlsx package, although note that this can become quite involved pretty easily. Excel files are surprisingly complicated…\nSimilarly, if you need to read/write Word documents, you’re going to need some packages. For Word, docxtractr (as the name suggests) is helpful for extracting data, while flextable can be used to help write to docx:\n\n# install.packages(\"docxtractr\")\n# install.packages(\"flextable\")\n\nlibrary(docxtractr)\nlibrary(flextable)\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  flextable() |&gt;\n  save_as_docx(path = \"data/word.docx\") # to write some data\n\n\n\nData in Word\n\nWe can then read this data back to show how extraction might work:\n\nmtcars_from_word &lt;- docxtractr::read_docx(\"data/word.docx\")\n\nBut, unlike Excel, we need to do some additional work to extract our data. docxtractr has identified a table, so we can convert that back into a tibble to get at its contents:\n\nmtcars_from_word |&gt;\n  docxtractr::docx_extract_tbl() |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n18.1\n6\n225.0\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n14.3\n8\n360.0\n245\n3.21\n3.570\n15.84\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n19.2\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.30\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n17.8\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.90\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n16.4\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n4.070\n17.40\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n17.3\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.730\n17.60\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n15.2\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.780\n18.00\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n10.4\n8\n472.0\n205\n2.93\n5.250\n17.98\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n10.4\n8\n460.0\n215\n3.00\n5.424\n17.82\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n14.7\n8\n440.0\n230\n3.23\n5.345\n17.42\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n15.5\n8\n318.0\n150\n2.76\n3.520\n16.87\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n15.2\n8\n304.0\n150\n3.15\n3.435\n17.30\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n13.3\n8\n350.0\n245\n3.73\n3.840\n15.41\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n19.2\n8\n400.0\n175\n3.08\n3.845\n17.05\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n27.3\n4\n79.0\n66\n4.08\n1.935\n18.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n26.0\n4\n120.3\n91\n4.43\n2.140\n16.70\n0\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n\n\n19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n\n\n21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nReading data from pdf is much more involved, and I’d suggest exploring the pdftools package as a starting point.\nAn alternative strategy if you need to write a lot of Word/pdf documents would be Rmarkdown or Quarto.

This training session gives a compare-and-contrast introduction to data.table by running through some core data operations in data.table and by comparing those to similar operations in base-R and tidyverse.\nThere’s some sample data that you might like to download and place in your project.\nThere’s also a bit of benchmark data here. This was generated in R4.4.1, Rstudio desktop 2025.05.1 on Windows 10, using a fairly new-ish laptop (Intel i7-13850HX, 128Gb RAM)."

    "text": "Reading data\nThis session is based on comparisons of simple tasks between base R, tidyverse, and data.table. We’ll start with three different methods for loading csv data which create subtly different objects in the three cases.\n\n\ndata.frame\ntibble\ndata.table\nbenchmark\n\n\n\n\ndf &lt;- read.csv(here(local_path))\n\n\n\n\ntb &lt;- read_csv(here(local_path))\n\n\n\n\ndt &lt;- fread(here(local_path))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn case these violin plots are new to you: these are the output of the microbenchmark package, which repeatedly runs bits of code while timing their speed of execution. The wider the violin (the white blobs) the greater the number of times the code ran at that speed. The further left the blob, the faster the code. Here, data.table’s fread ran much much faster than either base-R read.csv or tidyverse read_csv. There is some code for the benchmarking data here which is included for interest.\n\nCode# data reading ----\ndat_read &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df &lt;- read.csv(local_path),\n  tb &lt;- read_csv(local_path),\n  dt &lt;- fread(local_path)\n  )\n\n# col to col ----\n\ncol_subset &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df[\"month\"], # base-R ish subsetting\n  tb |&gt;\n    select(month), # tidy\n  dt[,.(month)] # dt\n  )\n\n# col to vec ----\n\nvec_subset2 &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df$month, # base-R ish subsetting\n  tb |&gt;\n    pull(month), # tidy\n  dt[, month] # usual DT approach\n  )\n\n# rows ----\n\nrow_subset &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df[1:2,], # rows\n  tb |&gt;\n    slice(1:2),\n  dt[1:2]\n  )\n\n# filter ----\n\nfilter_subset &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df[(df$dest == \"LAX\"),],\n  tb |&gt;\n    filter(dest == \"LAX\"),\n  dt[dest == \"LAX\"]\n  )\n\n# ungrouped summarize ----\n\nungrouped_summaries &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  data.frame(mean = mean(df$hour)),\n\n  tb |&gt;\n    summarise(mean = mean(hour)),\n\n  dt[,.(mean = mean(hour))]\n  )\n\n# grouped summarize ----\n\ngrouped_summaries &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  aggregate(hour ~ carrier, data = df, FUN = mean),\n\n  tb |&gt;\n    group_by(carrier) |&gt;\n    summarise(mean(hour)),\n\n  dt[,mean(hour), carrier]\n  )\n\n# subset then group then summarise ----\n\nsubset_grouped_summaries &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  aggregate(distance ~ carrier, data = subset(df, month == 9), FUN = \"sum\"),\n  \n  tb |&gt;\n    filter(month == 9) |&gt;\n    group_by(carrier) |&gt;\n    summarise(sum = sum(distance)),\n  \n  dt[month == 9, sum(distance), carrier]\n)\n\n# arrange ----\n\narranged &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df[order(df$dep_delay),],\n  tb |&gt;\n    arrange(dep_delay),\n  dt[order(dep_delay)]\n)\nautoplot(arranged)\n\n# count ----\n\ncounts &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  data.frame(table(df$carrier)),\n  tb |&gt;\n    count(carrier),\n  dt[, .(n = .N), by = carrier]\n)\n\n# mutate ----\n\nmutates &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  {df$dist_km &lt;- df$distance * 1.6\n  df[c(\"dist_km\", \"carrier\", \"origin\", \"dest\")]},\n  tidyverse = tb |&gt;\n    mutate(dist_km = distance * 1.6) |&gt;\n    select(dist_km, carrier, origin, dest),\n  dt[,.(dist_km = distance * 1.6, carrier, origin, dest)],\n  dt[,.(dist_km = distance*1.6),.(carrier,origin, dest)]\n  \n)\n\n# subset several cols\n\ncol_subset_multiple &lt;- microbenchmark(\n  df[c(\"day\", \"month\", \"year\")],\n  tb |&gt;\n    select(day, month, year),\n  dt[, list(\"day\", \"month\", \"year\")]\n)\n\nbench_dat &lt;- list(dat_read = dat_read, \n                  col_subset = col_subset, \n                  vec_subset = vec_subset, \n                  row_subset = row_subset, \n                  filter_subset = filter_subset, \n                  ungrouped_summaries = ungrouped_summaries, \n                  grouped_summaries = grouped_summaries, \n                  subset_grouped_summaries = subset_grouped_summaries, \n                  arranged = arranged, \n                  counts = counts, \n                  mutates = mutates,\n                  col_subset_multiple = col_subset_multiple) \n \nwrite_rds(bench_dat, \"data/bench_dat.rds\")"

You can create data.tables using fread, or with care, convert data.frames/tibbles using setDT. The reason for needing care is that setDT (and a few other functions in data.table) modify in place. This is one of the few cases in R where you can change an object without assigning:\n\ntest &lt;- tibble(alph = letters) # make a tibble\nclass(test) # shows \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\nsetDT(test) # note modify-in-place\nclass(test) # that's a data.table\n\n[1] \"data.table\" \"data.frame\"\n\nsetDF(test) # back into a df\nclass(test) # and that's a data.frame\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\ntest &lt;- as_tibble(test) # if you need a tibble\nclass(test)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\""

    "text": "What’s the big idea\nIf you’re used to working with tidyverse, data.table takes a radically different approach to working with data. The standard way of representing data.table syntax is as follows:\n\ndt[i, j, by]\n\nThis means:\n\ntake dt - a data.table\nsubset or reorder its rows by i\n\nsubset columns or calculate by j\n\nwhile grouping by by\n\n\nUnless you’ve done lots of SQL before, that’s likely to be confusing. So let’s do some simple operations first, then return to the overview."

    "text": "Investigating data\nDplyr is usually used as a toolkit for manipulating tidy data. This session concentrates on some lesser-used functions in the dplyr package that are especially useful earlier in the analysis lifecycle when exploring new data: slice(), glimpse(), rename(), relocate(), case_when()/case_match(), and consecutive_id()\nPackage loading as follows:\n\nlibrary(NHSRdatasets)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nslice()\nIt’s definitely worth pointing you towards the slice() manual page - it’s clear and interesting.\nAt its simplest, slice() is an alternative to head:\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(1:6)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      1           21289     2879       5060\n2 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n3 2017-03-01 RF4      other        2850        6          0\n4 2017-03-01 R1H      1           30210     5902       6943\n5 2017-03-01 R1H      2             807       11          0\n6 2017-03-01 R1H      other       11352      136          0\n\n\nThe number supplied to slice() returns that row - so slice(3) shows the third row. You can also provide a sequence or vector of rows:\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(1:3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      1           21289     2879       5060\n2 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n3 2017-03-01 RF4      other        2850        6          0\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(2,5,918)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n2 2017-03-01 R1H      2             807       11          0\n3 2017-01-01 RQ6      other       10253        0          0\n\n\nMore interestingly, you can group_by(), then slice, to see the first row of each group. Here, the data is filtered, grouped by org_code, then we slice the top row of each group:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(attendances &gt;= 22000) |&gt;\n  group_by(org_code) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n# Groups:   org_code [4]\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-10-01 R0A      1           22392     3628       6836\n2 2017-03-01 R1H      1           30210     5902       6943\n3 2019-03-01 RRK      1           32017    10670      10850\n4 2017-03-01 RW6      1           22930     4997       5328\n\n\n(we’ll explore group_by() in the summarising data with dplyr session, so don’t worry if this is unfamiliar)\nThe slice_min() and slice_max() functions are also useful, giving you something like an integrated arrange() for looking at slices of the data:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"1\") |&gt;\n  slice_max(breaches, n=1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2019-01-01 RRK      1           31935    12502      11493\n\n# equivalent to\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(breaches)) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2019-01-01 RRK      1           31935    12502      11493\n\n\n(note that you need to explicitly name the number of rows you want using n=...)\nslice_min() and slice_max() are particularly useful for groups:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"1\") |&gt;\n  group_by(org_code) |&gt;\n  slice_max(breaches, n=1) \n\n# A tibble: 140 × 6\n# Groups:   org_code [140]\n   period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 R0A      1           21980     6206       6985\n 2 2018-11-01 R1F      1            3810     1262        967\n 3 2017-01-01 R1H      1           28420     7426       6435\n 4 2017-01-01 R1K      1           11961     5897       4587\n 5 2019-01-01 RA2      1            6242     1071       2513\n 6 2017-01-01 RA3      1            4073     1471       1074\n 7 2016-06-01 RA4      1            3992      454       1057\n 8 2016-11-01 RA7      1            9625     2445       3064\n 9 2019-01-01 RA9      1            6056     2053       2557\n10 2019-03-01 RAE      1           10698     3438       2854\n# ℹ 130 more rows\n\n\nslice_sample() gives a random sampling of the data.\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=6) \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-04-01 RFF      1            6841      750       2067\n2 2017-10-01 RHM      1            8832      957       3143\n3 2016-10-01 RJ6      other        3617      275          0\n4 2016-10-01 RR8      other        2118        0          0\n5 2017-08-01 RTD      1            9780      738       2266\n6 2018-10-01 RAT      other        5005       30          0\n\n\nThere are also slice_head() and slice_tail() functions which work in the same way.\nFinal tip - slice with a negative index can be used as like filter() to remove the specified row(s):\n\n# returns the last 5 rows only\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(-1:-12760)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2018-04-01 Y02584   other         471        0          0\n2 2018-04-01 RA3      1            3825      476       1016\n3 2018-04-01 AXG      other        2980       24          0\n4 2018-04-01 NLX24    other        1538        0          0\n5 2018-04-01 RA4      1            4388       82       1292\n\n\nglimpse()\nglimpse() is a data viewing function similar to print(), except it transposes the data so that each column is displayed as a row. This is particularly useful for wide data with many columns, especially when you are interested in checking the class (date, character, etc.) of your columns.\n\nsynthetic_news_data |&gt; \n  glimpse() \n\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 12\n$ male  &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1…\n$ age   &lt;int&gt; 68, 94, 85, 44, 77, 58, 25, 69, 91, 70, 87, 93, 61, 75, 97, 80, …\n$ NEWS  &lt;int&gt; 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 7, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 2…\n$ syst  &lt;int&gt; 150, 145, 169, 154, 122, 146, 65, 116, 162, 132, 110, 166, 123, …\n$ dias  &lt;int&gt; 98, 67, 69, 106, 67, 106, 42, 56, 72, 96, 85, 90, 78, 80, 72, 81…\n$ temp  &lt;dbl&gt; 36.8, 35.0, 36.2, 36.9, 36.4, 35.3, 35.6, 37.2, 35.5, 35.3, 37.0…\n$ pulse &lt;int&gt; 78, 62, 54, 80, 62, 73, 72, 90, 60, 67, 95, 87, 93, 65, 89, 145,…\n$ resp  &lt;int&gt; 26, 18, 18, 17, 20, 20, 12, 16, 16, 16, 24, 16, 26, 12, 16, 16, …\n$ sat   &lt;int&gt; 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 98, 99, 97, 99, 97, 87, 95, 96, 96, 98, 99, …\n$ sup   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ alert &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ died  &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n\n\nNote the useful dimension information in the first two lines, and the class information in angle brackets.

There are a few different ways of joining data in dplyr, and we’ll explore the following approaches during this session:\n\n\nbinding joins, which are joins where data are added based on position. For example, we merge the each of the first columns in the two tibbles into one new first column.\n\nmutating joins, which are joins where data are added by values to match existing data. For example, we might match two tibbles based on CHI number, and connect two otherwise dissimilar data sets together.\n\nfiltering joins, where we filter one dataset using a joining relationship. For example, we might remove any individuals from a dataset based on their CHI appearing in a second dataset\n\nnon-equi joins, which we’ll only mention here, but will deal with properly in a more developed follow-up session"

It usually means that R is having some unusual difficulty in recognizing the R code you’re written as being R code. It’s hard to solve because you don’t have a nice informative error message (or anything else) to look at. Things to check at this point are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of generic R troubleshooting strategies\n\n\n\n\nmake sure the last line of the console has a &gt; rather than a +. If you see +, R is waiting for you to do something. Press Esc a couple of times, then try your code again\ntry running some new code in the console (2 + 2 if more than enough)\nrestart R (Ctrl + Shift + F10)\nterminate R (Session menu)\nclose and reopen Rstudio (or hard-refresh Ctrl+F5 the page for Posit)\nmake sure the code you’re trying to run is saved as an .R file\nif you’re on the desktop, make sure you have R installed on your machine\n\ntry opening a different project and seeing if that code will run\n\n\n\nI’m getting an error message\nMost R error messages tell you what’s wrong by providing an error message in the console. In fact, many R functions will also tell you what’s gone right there too. The term of art here is that R code is generally surly - it complains a lot, even when things are going right. Here, we’re going to ignore those informative messages, and concentrate on proper errors that prevent your code from running properly.\nMy output is wonky\nThe opposite problem: your code seems to run perfectly, but you don’t get the output you’re expecting. Given that you don’t have an error message to work from, you’ll need to try and work backwards from the output you’re expecting. But a few examples of output that’s gone wrong:\n\nnumeric values are bigger/smaller than expected\ntext is incorrect, poorly-formatted, squishedtogether, or IN THE WRONG CASE\ngraphs miss values or mis-represent values\nthe possibilities are endless\n\nIn general, finding and fixing output problems is a manual business.

    "text": "Pin-pointing problems\nTo solve an error you’ll almost always need to refine your understanding of a) what’s gone wrong, and b) where it’s gone wrong.\nRead the error message\nObvious but takes practice. Most R error messages give you clues as to how to find and fix the problem. The key here is that a) the message will contain the word Error and b) your code will stop running. Many errors from more recent packages have nice explanations and fixes. In general, the older the function, the more difficult the error. That wasn’t always the case, and some older R functions have horrid error messages. Here’s a short dictionary for some classics:\n\n\ncould not find function ‘thing’ = you’ve mis-spelled a function name or failed to load a package\n\nthere is no package called ‘glok’ = you’ve mis-spelled a package name - or you haven’t installed it\n\nobject 'mpg' not found = you haven’t created an object, or you’ve missed a pipe somewhere\n\nnon-numeric argument to binary operator = you’ve tried to do maths with words somewhere\n\nlonger object length is not a multiple of shorter object length or length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent = you’ve fallen into vector recycling rules\n\nlots of weird errors about filter - make sure you’re using dplyr::filter specifically\nFinding errors\nUnlike many programming languages, R doesn’t give you a line number for errors. It is possible, but a bit messy, to add line numbers, but might be worth it if you’re coming from Python or similar. You can usually see the malfunctioning line of code immediately above the error message in the console.\nIf your error message isn’t that helpful, you can try running the traceback() command in the console, which will show you the series of steps that led to your last error. The trick here is to read bottom-to-top: the top of the traceback() output was the last function that ran before R fell over.\nYou can also, if you’re getting desperate, try some old-fashioned print debugging, by putting some print(\"some label\") statements into your code. They’ll appear in the console, so you might be able to detect the location of your error if all else fails. But really, if you’re at this point you should probably move onto a more involved strategy…\nCheck the basic stuff\nIf that hasn’t worked, we’re into debugging proper. So, at this point, make sure that you’ve restart R to clean up your environment, run your code again, and then looked carefully at your output/error message to decide what’s wrong with it. At this point, I’d also try to write the problem down, which is an effective but irrational strategy that often seems to yield results.\nAssuming that fails, we can run through a set of quick checks that are always worth trying:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of basic code errors\n\n\n\n\ncheck your brackets - Code &gt; Rainbow parentheses (or rainbow brackets for those of us in British-inflected English) are fantastic for this\nlook for easy transpositions like &lt; / &gt;, + / -\n\ncheck that your function names are correct, and you’re not accidentally using false-friends (class() and typeof() are really nice examples)\n\na quick check of each function’s help at this point, just to check it really does what you think it does, is highly recommended\n\n\nensure all your packages are installed and loaded. If in doubt, use namespacing package::function\n\nmake sure that you’re actually looking at this code’s output, and haven’t accidentally calculated something without showing it…\n\n\nresult &lt;- 1+5+8+9\nprint(results) # slightly different variable name"

    "text": "Isolating errors\nIf you can’t find your problem fairly easily, then you need to cut your code down to size to make your search easier.\nMake a minimal example\nThe best advice for tricky problems is to make your problem as specific as problem. That means removing any irrelevant code. We’ll call this the minimal example. Assuming that you’ve already tried the sequence of basic troubleshooting steps above, you’d go about it as follows:\n\n\nswitch off any unnecessary parts of your code to pin down where the error is happening\n\nyou can do that by adding # or Ctrl+Shift+c\n\nor, probably cognitively better, copy the misbehaving code to a new script\n\n\ntry to run that extracted piece of code (again, probably after restarting R)\n\nyou’ll almost certainly need to load packages, and add other pieces of code to get it to run\nwhatever you do, do the minimum. No loading all the usual packages, no copy-pasting great gobbets of code around the place, just try and keep the script as simple as possible\n\n\nwhen you’ve got the code to run, you’ll either:\n\nhave the same error again, in which case you’re in a much better position to do the same thing again to localise the error within that new, simpler, script you’ve just built\nhave fixed the error, in which case you now know what you need to look elsewhere in your original code for the source of the problem\nhave given yourself a brand-new error to focus on. Lucky you! Definitely try to fix that new error before proceeding\n\n\n\nIf that doesn’t work, it’s time to look up the chain to the inputs of this piece of code. I’d work as follows:\n\ncheck for types - so if you’re expecting your code to add numbers together, ensure that your inputs are both numbers\ncheck that the variable names line up\ncheck that there’s no other code that could potentially alter any of your inputs\nfinally, repeat the isolation exercise above for each input\nReprex\n= reproducible example. See the documentation for the reprex package, especially the helpful set of do’s and don’t.\nIf the minimal example method above doesn’t find your problem, you’re probably going to need to ask for help. Luckily, the preparatory work you’ll need for that is itself directly helpful in solving your problem.\nGenerally, when people want to help you with your R code, the first thing they’ll want to do is to run it. A reprex is a way of packaging up everything your code needs so that anyone can copy and paste it. This is important, because a bare snippet of code doesn’t tell the full story. For example, say this bit of code isn’t working for me:\n\nmy_data |&gt;\n  filter(flavours = \"chocolate\") |&gt;\n  transmogrify() \n\nA potential ally and helper won’t be able to assist me with this as it stands. They won’t know about my data, they won’t know which packages I’m using, and (last line) they won’t even recognize the function name that I just made up. To save a lot of annoying back and forth, you should turn this into a minimal example (see above), and then use reprex to help your helpers. I need at least the following bits to make this code reproducible:\n\nthe data\nan idea of which package the filter() comes from\na definition of transmogrify()\n\n\nThat breaks down as follows:\n\nprovide a short snippet of data\ninclude any relevant package loading\ninclude the function definition for any non-package functions\n\n\nmy_data &lt;- dplyr::tibble(flavours = c(\"chocolate\", \"onion\", \"chocolate\"),\n                  scoop_size = c(100,120,100),\n                  count = c(200,500,400)) # give a preview of the data in a copy/pastable format\n\ntransmogrify &lt;- function(df){\n  df |&gt;\n    dplyr::summarise(total_vol_l = sum(scoop_size * count)/1000) # add the function definition\n}\n\nmy_data |&gt; # I can now run this and find the error!\n  dplyr::filter(flavours = \"chocolate\") |&gt; # dplyr's filter\n  transmogrify() \n\n\nThis usually means that you’ve used = instead of ==.\n\nGetting data together for a reprex is the most painful bit, particularly if you’re dealing with something real-world and lengthy. I like the datapasta package for this, as it has the useful function tribble_format that will take some data and turn it into a copy/pastable format that you can use in a reprex.\n\ndatapasta::tribble_format(head(mtcars, 4))"

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nMore so than in other programming languages, R functions bias towards helping the user do common tasks easily. One excellent example is the way that tidyverse functions (like dplyr) make assumptions about what users mean when they refer to variables. As an example, if you want to select a column in base R you’d use a quoted column name in single brackets:\n\nstranded_data[\"age\"]\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nDoing that in the tidyverse is easier: use an unquoted column name inside select:\n\nstranded_data |&gt; \n  select(age) \n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nThat’s conceptually helpful because we’re used to referring to ordinary R objects using unquoted variable names. When we specify the age column in this select function, we don’t need to tell R that we specifically mean the age column in the stranded_data tibble. That’s very helpful, because it saves us having to specify that we want to refer to a specific column in a specific tibble each time we write a line of dplyr. Even if we create another tibble that also has an age column…\n\nnew_stranded_data &lt;- stranded_data |&gt;\n  select(stranded.label, age)\n\n… we can still just refer to the age column of the original stranded_data without any risk of confusion. This simplification - which we’ll call data masking - is a great advantage of using the pipe, and most of the time data masking just works without giving rise to any problems at all. For example, we can write a vector of column names, and then pass it to select(), and R will figure out that we want to use those names as column names without any extra effort on our part:\n\nmy_cols &lt;- c(\"age\")\n\nstranded_data |&gt;\n  select(any_of(my_cols)) # need to use a helper function like any_of since dplyr 1.1.0\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nHowever, when that data masking goes wrong it can be very challenging to fix. To demonstrate, let’s start taking the column-selecting code snippets above, and translating them into functions. Base-R first:\n\ncolumn_pick_base &lt;- function(col){\n  stranded_data[col]\n}\ncolumn_pick_base(\"age\")\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nThat’s simple - we pass a quoted column name to the function, and it returns us the relevant column of data. But if we do the apparently-simple translation to use select, things start going wrong:\n\ncolumn_pick_tidy &lt;- function(col){\n  stranded_data |&gt;\n    select(col)\n}\n\nThat works almost as expected if we pass a quoted column name:\n\ncolumn_pick_tidy(\"age\")\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nOkay, so we get a deprecated warning to the effect that selecting functions expect unquoted column names. So let’s update the function call to do that now:\n\ntry(column_pick_tidy(age))\n\nError in eval(expr, envir) : object 'age' not found\n\n\nUh-oh. This has gone wrong. Unfortunately, to explain why it’s gone wrong, we’re going to need to think about how data masking really works. We shouldn’t try to use the non-standard quoted column “kludge” as that will complicate e.g. using our new function in another function. A stronger approach is to adjust our function code in the first place, so that we don’t have to call our function in a non-standard way (why write age in some functions, but “age” in others to refer to the same thing).\nIn this section, we’ll give a bit of helpful theoretical background about data masking. We’ll then go on to look at four ways of resolving some of the difficulties that data masking can cause."

Note that many base R functions do often require the user to bear this distinction in mind. For instance, in base R you would specify a data variable differently from an environment variable:\n\nmtcars$cyl      # a data variable\ncyl &lt;- c(4,6,8) # an environment variable\n\nWhereas in tidyverse, you can:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(cyl) # specifying a data variable like an environment variable inside select\n\nMost of the time, data masking doesn’t cause any problems. However, when you start wanting to include tidyverse functions inside other functions - say, if you’re trying to purrrr something - that blurring raises a problem. We won’t give much of an explanation as to the reasons for this, although do read this introduction to the topic and this more detailed account if you are interested in the technical aspects.

First, replacing = with := injects the supplied column name. Then the new column name is created using glue() syntax. glue() is a neat replacement for base-R tools like paste0(). Empirically, though, a quoted string with {{}} containing the function argument will do the work for you.\n:= is borrowed from mathematics, and is used when defining something new, which is the apparent logic behind its use here. If you try and use = in this context, it’ll fail because of the consistency checks that tidyverse functions use to check that all’s okay with newly-defined names."

The course builds on existing knowledge and provides a more in depth understanding of important functions, most of which I was aware existed and/or used previously but without much confidence. This has not only given me a boost in how I view my existing skills but also given me an apetite for investigating a more adventurous usage of Excel.\nMany of these functions can be found by googling and simply copying the format to suit your needs; the value of this session is to understand the “how” and “why” that sits behind.\nVery good, bit mind boggling and need to go back and play about, put into practice to really embed it.

Leaving aside the reasons why iteration isn’t that important for now - although we will return to it later - we’ll start with a very basic introduction to loops."

    "text": "Breaks and next\nbreak\nWhen encountered, break completely stops the execution of the loop. For example, say we have some random numbers:\nSay we want to loop through some random_numbers and do something until we get to a number larger than a threshold value:\n[1] 11 [1] 171 [1] 271 [1] 61 [1] 191 [1] 311 [1] 201 [1] 291 [1] 321 [1] 71\nWe can use a break, which will stop the loop completely when an if() condition is met:\n[1] 11\nIf you’re using nested loops, and a break is encountered in the inner loop, it will return you to the outer loop (or the next level up):\n[1] 2 [1] 3 [1] 4 [1] 5 [1] 6 [1] “This is where the inner loop breaks, and returns to the outer loop” [1] 3 [1] 4 [1] 5 [1] 6 [1] 7 [1] “This is where the inner loop breaks, and returns to the outer loop” [1] 4 [1] 5 [1] 6 [1] 7 [1] “This is where the inner loop breaks, and returns to the outer loop” [1] 5 [1] 6 [1] 7 [1] “This is where the inner loop breaks, and returns to the outer loop” [1] 6 [1] 7 [1] “This is where the inner loop breaks, and returns to the outer loop”\nnext\nWhen encountered, next moves on to the next iteration of the loop. It’s usual to combine it with a test condition (using an if() statement). For example, we could use next to write a simple fizz buzz programme:\n[1] 1 [1] 2 [1] “fizz” [1] 4 [1] “buzz” [1] “fizz” [1] 7 [1] 8 [1] “fizz” [1] “buzz” [1] 11 [1] “fizz” [1] 13 [1] 14 [1] “fizzbuzz”"

Approximately:\n\n\n{\"Area Name\"} is the grouping variable. If you update this to {\"Area Name\", \"Question Number\"}, it’ll add the question number as a second layer of grouping\n\n\"total_responses\" is the name of the new column\n\neach List.Sum([Number of responses to question]) describes how the aggregation (sum) takes place.

For example, if you click on one of the practices on the map, your population table should update appropriately. Similarly, click on the population table, and your map should update too to reflect the selected areas. This type of two-way filtering behaviour is the default, and (slightly confusingly) the cross-filter direction toggle in the Properties pane of the relationship won’t change it.\nCross-filtering should nearly always be one-way to avoid vagueness in your model. But there is one case where it might be useful to demonstrate a two-way cross-filter on a relationship, which is where you want two slicers to filter each other. We’ll demonstrate that using two slicers, with one using GPPracticeName, and the other DZ."

That’s starting to approximate a star schema\nIn a star schema, your data is broken into several tables which are joined by relationships. Most of the data is held in dimension tables, which contain data on a theme. For example, our population table above is effectively a dimension table, because it holds all the information about the population in some datazone. That data is organised by primary key - here, the datazone codes in the DZ column - which uniquely identify rows in the table.\nEach dimension table is then joined by a relationship to a single fact table. The fact table contains only the unique combinations of the primary keys from the dimensions table. So, if we were star schema-ing our GP data, our fact table would contain the following:\n\nThat’s one row per practice, with the unique PracticeCodes in one column, their health board in the HB column - that’s boring because all our practices in this dataset are in Orkney, but would be more interesting and useful if we were dealing with practices from several NHS boards - and the non-unique datazone of each GP practice."

We discuss these more fully in our intermediate Power BI sessions, but approximately you can:\n\nduplicate a query, which re-creates the whole process from scratch by loading the data from source again. This is slower, because you need to duplicate a lot of work, but makes for fully-independent queries. You can, for example, duplicate a query and then safely delete the original query without causing trouble\nor you can reference a query, which takes a snapshot of an existing query. This is faster than duplicating, but means that your daughter query depends on the original query, and if you change the original then your daughter query will potentially change/break too\n\nFor this practice session, keep things simple. Create four duplicates of your s05_full_data query, and rename them main_table, demographics, boards, population, practice_details. Don’t try and leave a spare copy of your original data hanging around, because that’ll complicate building relationships later.\nSelecting columns\n\nstart with the main table. Here, this table will only contain keys, which are the unique values that describe our different GP practices, health board(s), and datazones\nthe Choose Columns tool is definitely the most friendly way of doing this selection \nDuplicate rows\n\n\nThe Remove Duplicates function is tricky, because it changes its behaviour depending on the selected columns. If you select a single column, Remove Duplicates will remove any duplicates in that column only and will ignore other columns, meaning that you can potentially miss combinations in your data. So given this sort of raw data, which contains no duplicated rows:\n\n\nRemove Duplicates on var1 (with the formula = Table.Distinct(#\"Changed Type\", {\"var1\"})) will incorrectly remove some rows:\n\nThat clearly misses some unique combinations of var1 and var2 in the data. Make sure you select all the columns (ideally using Ctrl + A) before running Remove Duplicates. Note that reading the formula is useful here, because the correct formula (= Table.Distinct(#\"``Changed Type``\")) doesn’t specify any column names."

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"

Specifically, we’d expect attendees to be able to confidently:\n\nopen, save, close Excel files, and add worksheets to existing Excel workbooks\nunderstand how A1 referencing works\nread and write simple Excel formulas\nunderstand and change basic number formatting (for example, getting dates to behave)\n\nIf you can’t do any of these, or you’d have to think hard about how to do them, we’d strongly suggest that you attend the beginner’s course first before moving on to the intermediate-level sessions."

Iteration is a basic building block of code in almost all programming languages, and you’d usually expect people who work with code to be very familiar with loops from the very beginning of their learning journey. Not so R, which is an oddity with respect to iteration. Iteration is much less important in R than in most languages, and that means that most of us encounter it comparatively infrequently. Leaving aside the reasons why iteration isn’t that important for now - although we will return to it later - we’ll start with a very basic introduction to loops."

But you should also be able to knit using rmarkdown::render() to produce some output. Together, those three elements look like this:\n\n\nRmarkdown\nRender code\nOutput\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Plain Rmarkdown\"\noutput: html_document\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(\"Hello world\")\n```\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"01_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gets more interesting when you start specifying options inside render. A basic example of this would be to change the output filename by adding output_file:\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.html\")\nWe could also change our output format. By default, rmarkdown docs get rendered to whatever is specified in the header. That’s HTML in our case, but we could fiddle that to give us .pdf output:\nrmarkdown::render(\"Rmarkdown.Rmd\", \n                  output_file = \"Rmarkdown_plain.pdf\",\n                  output_format = pdf_document)\nNote that we’re still producing the same output each time, albeit with different filenames and in different formats. The next part is to add params, which will enable us to change the content. We need to make two changes to our Rmd first:\n\n\nRmarkdown\nRender code\nOutput\n\n\n\nWe add params in the header, and some code (params$name) to access their values in the body of our Rmarkdown document:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add some params in our render code to produce a different output. Note that, as we set defaults in the Rmarkdown header, these params are optional. But if we do include params in our render call, they will over-ride the defaults:\n\n\nRmarkdown\nRender code\nOutput\n\n\n\nSame Rmarkdown:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\",\n                  params = list(name = \"Steve\")) # new param"

First, R is based on the idea of packages, where you’re encouraged to outsource specialist functions to your R installation in a repeatable and standard way. There’s basically a package for everything - something over 20000 at present. Second, R encourages reproducible analytics: the idea being you write your script once, and then run it many times as your data changes, producing standardised outputs by design.\nTogether, that design makes R a force-multiplier for fancier data work: use packages to replicate your existing work in a reproducible way, then use the time saved in your routine reporting to improve and extend the work. There are other features of code-based analytics which make collaborating and developing more complex projects typically much smoother than they would be in non-code tools like Excel."

Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I've read: Tom Lean's Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn't do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries.\"\n\nbotw[5,] |&gt;\n  select(Author, Year) # subsetting by index and columns and returning a tibble\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Author   Year \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Tom Lean 2016 \n\nbotw |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt; 2010) |&gt;\n  arrange(Year) #
