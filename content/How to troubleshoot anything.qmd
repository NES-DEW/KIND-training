## Introduction

+ there are lots of ways that data tools can go wrong
+ this session is about building your troubleshooting skills: helping you identify and fix problems
+ most troubleshooting skills are **generic**: if you're able to use them for one tool, you can apply them to another tool
+ technical/specific knowledge is important too
+ troubleshooting skills are distinct from learning how to do new things
  + but you'll often encounter them together

## "I've got a problem"

+ a few common patterns of problems. Imagine we're doing some job x.
    + x doesn't do anything/doesn't run
    + x gives the wrong result
    + x gives a weird result

## "What happened?"

## "What have you tried?" Irrational strategies

+ often helpful, but entirely non-specific
    + try it again
    + do something else, then try again
    + restart the software and try again
    + restart your computer and try again

## "Was there an error message?"

+ skim the error message. Half the time, the error message will have the solution - it might just require a bit of sifting/interpretation
+ copy the message, and search online (one search, two links)

## "When did it happen?"

+ try to replicate the error in miniature


+ look at my code/whatever carefully
+ read the error message carefully




+ proper search for help
+ minimal/reproducible example
+ ask for help

# discovering when a problem has happened


# reading error messages
# searching and using genAI chat for help
