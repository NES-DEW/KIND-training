## Some sample data

| user   | pre-training score  | post-training score  | session |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Steve  | 4                   | 6                    | Excel 1 |
| Emma   | 7                   | 6                    | Excel 2 |
| Bhavin | 3                   | 9                    | Excel 1 |

## References

-   Excel sheets are made up of cells
-   cells are arranged in rows and columns
    -   columns have letters - like `C`
    -   rows have numbers - like `3`
-   references are the 'address' of a particular cell - like `C3`
    -   you can 'point' at a cell by using its reference

## Finding a reference

-   from the **name box**: </br> ![Name box](../src/images/clipboard-1746127255.png)
-   or work out from the column and row labels
    -   always column letter, then row number
    -   **C3**, not **3C**

## Using a reference

-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell
-   formulas start with an `=`
-   so we'll use `= C3` to get Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)

## References in formulas

-   we use references to allow us to pass data around our spreadsheet
- an example: how much did Emma's score improve during the session?
-  calculate this with `= C3 - C2`

## References move

-   by default, Excel references are **relative**
-   when you move a reference, the cell that reference points to also moves </br> ![References are relative](../src/images/clipboard-754991469.png){width="200"}
-   it is possible to 'fix' references so that they not move
    -   we call these **absolute** references
    -   the `$` fixes a reference, so `$C$3` is absolute
![Using Absolute References](../src/images/absolute_reference_image.png)

## You can name things

-   almost everything in Excel can be named
-   the easy way to start with that is using the **name box**
-   names can replace references in formulas
-   this is valuable when things get more complicated

## You can use and manage names

-   via the **Name manager** (`Ctrl` + `F3`)
-   **Go to** (`F5`)

# Practical

## Using a reference

-   we can write a formula that copies the value from `C3` into another cell

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
-   go to an empty cell, type `= C3`, and press `Enter/‚èé`
-   that cell should now have Emma's post-training score (or whatever value you referenced)
:::

## References in formulas

-   how much did people improve during the training session?

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   add a new column called `improvement`
-   in the first row of that column, add the formula: `= C2 - B2`
    -   that calculates the post-training score minus the pre-training score</br> ![](../src/images/clipboard-2200716982.png){height="120"}
- then copy/fill down
:::

## References move

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   try copying your new block of `improvement` cells around your sheet
-   their value should change (almost certainly to a `#VALUE` error)
-   now try clicking those cells to see where the updated reference points to </br> ![where does the updated reference point to?](../src/images/clipboard-754991469.png)
:::

## Absolute references

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   delete your copied blocks of cells from the last step
-   now update your references by adding `$` before the letter and number
    -   so `C2` becomes `$C$2`
    -   you might prefer to press `F4` instead
-   now copy and paste those blocks of cells again. What's different this time?
-   please delete those new blocks of cells when you're finished
:::

## You can name things

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   let's average the `post-training score` column
-   in a new cell (`C5` perhaps?) add this formula:
    -   `=AVERAGE(C2, C3, C4)`
-   now name that new cell `av_score` and try using it in a formula
    -   `= INT(av_length)` would round that to the nearest whole number
:::

## You can manage those names

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   find the **Name manager** (or press `Ctrl` + `F3`) </br> ![Name manager](../src/images/clipboard-3382288451.png)
-   try renaming your `av_score` cell
-   try making a new named **range** from your three `pre-training score` cells
-   try using the `F5` Go to interface to navigate between your named cells
