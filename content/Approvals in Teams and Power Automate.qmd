## Prerequisites for this session

-   good general digital skills
-   prior experience of writing your own Flows in Power Automate
-   appropriate M365 access and permissions for Forms, Power Automate, and Teams

## Introduction

-   Teams Approvals = the right answer for digital processes that need human decision-making
-   "when a user submits a form, send the response to me for approval"
- if an anyone is sending you a Word/Excel form, and you're making a decision based on that form, this process could save you time and pain

## Set-up

-   [make.powerautomate.com](https://make.powerautomate.com)
-   create a new instant flow using `Manually trigger a flow`
-   add a `Start and wait for an approval`
-   approval options
    -   `Approve/Reject`
    -   `Assigned to` yourself
    -   title and details as you like
-   save and test - keep an eye out for permissions </br> ![Overall flow](../src/images/clipboard-398192087.png)

## Result!

-   Teams approval should appear </br>![Teams approval](../src/images/clipboard-1858339355.png)
-   and an email... </br>![Email approval](../src/images/clipboard-3242366602.png)
-   in Teams, add a comment, and click `Approve`

## Several things happen

-   Teams approvals keeps a neat log of events for you </br>![Teams approval log](../src/images/clipboard-1263615662.png)
-   The user will receive a notification of the approval in Teams
-   Power Automate gets a lot of information back about the approval

## Back to Power Automate

-   edit your flow and add an email notification
-   note that you get a lot of options for taking parts of the referral </br> ![Dynamic approval parts](../src/images/clipboard-2464098671.png)
-   build yourself an email with the approval comment and the date-time </br>![Example email setup](../src/images/clipboard-3887599392.png)
-   then re-test your approval

## Control flow

-   you can add a condition - just note that you need to use the work `Approve` in the condition </br>![Control flow on approvals](../src/images/clipboard-3044742246.png)
- add different emails to each side of the control, then test both cases
