</header><section id="introduction" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a short practical session designed to walk users through creating a first plot in plotly. Youâ€™ll need at least a bit of prior R experience before, but assuming youâ€™ve ever written an R script before, you should be fine. The session introduces some plotly basics, and compares their implementation with similar graphs in ggplot.</p>
</section><section id="at-a-glance" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="at-a-glance">At a glanceâ€¦</h2>
<ul>
<li>plotly is the major alternative to ggplot</li>
<li>the code is longer, but easier to understand</li>
<li>the basics are better (accessibility and interactivity, especially)</li>
<li>but thereâ€™s a much smaller plotly user base</li>
<li>and itâ€™s a big jump from either base R or ggplot</li>
<li>the main reason youâ€™re not using it already: the <a href="https://plotly.com/r/bar-charts/">documentation is generally poor</a> (although <a href="https://plotly-r.com/">Sievertâ€™s book</a> is very good)</li>

</section><section id="starting-a-plot-object" class="level2"><h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="starting-a-plot-object">Starting a plot object</h2>
<p>Note the plotly is interactive from the start - mouse over, see extra information, and control e.g.&nbsp;zoom from the top panel menu</p>

<p>Two big differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>plotly will make an educated guess about the best way to represent your data, while ggplot doesnâ€™t</li>
<li>plotly uses <code>~</code> to indicate how variables map onto axes etc, rather than <code>aes()</code>
</li>
</ul>
