## Current schedule

Most KIND training happens in six-week core training blocks that repeat four times per year. Most of our training - especially the Excel and Power BI courses - will be contained in those blocks. The blocks broadly align with school terms, because that's when (empirically) we get the best attendance at training.

This year, those core blocks will be:

- Autumn 2025: 3rd Nov to 12th Dec 2025
- Winter 2026: 12th Jan to 27th Feb 2026
- Spring 2026: 28th April to 12th June 2026
- Summer 2026: 24th Aug to 9th Oct 2026
- Autumn 2026: 2nd Nov to 17th Dec 2026


<!-- ### Theme weeks -->

<!-- Theme weeks occupy a whole week with a single topic, with 10-20 events scheduled on a single topic. This year, we'll have the following theme weeks: -->

<!-- + week commencing 19th May 2025 - Power Query -->
<!-- + w/c 30th June 2025 - Debugging/Troubleshooting -->
