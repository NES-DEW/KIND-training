## About this course

* This course is designed as a basic introduction to SQL delivered as live interactive sessions on Teams
* It's intended as a light introduction for users with good general digital skills (broadly level 2 in the [Digital and Data Capability Framework](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/76134))
* It's heavily based on the excellent [W3 schools introductory SQL course](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)
    * If you're looking for a resource to use to support independent study, [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) is a better option than this page
    * this material is largely intended to support our live interactive training sessions
* we use [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) for this course. Although that platform is mainly meant for analysts writing R code, we can trick it to allow us to practice our SQL skills
