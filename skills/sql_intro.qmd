## About this session

This introductory session aims to give you a quick and easy introduction to SQL. That will include:

* how data is held in SQL (as tables)
* how you can investigate that data using SQL queries
* and showing some of the basic tools that you can use to query and reshape data in SQL

## Setup

* You will need a free [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account. Please set this up and check that you have access before the session begins
* Once you've logged-in to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/), please create a new Rstudio project </br>![New Rstudio project](src/images/sql_intro_create_project.png)
* In that project, create a new R script: </br>![Create a new R script from the file menu](src/images/sql_intro_create_script.png)
* Copy and paste the following R code into that script:

```{r r-script}
#| eval: false

## install and attach R packages
pkg <- c("dbplyr", "RSQLite", "palmerpenguins")
install.packages(setdiff(pkg, rownames(installed.packages())))  
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

conn <- src_memdb() # create an sqlite db in memory
copy_to(conn, penguins, overwrite = T) # populate that db from R
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

conn <- src_memdb() # create an sqlite db in memory
copy_to(conn, penguins) # populate that db from R
```

* save your script and click the `Source` button
    * that will create a simple SQL database in memory
* now create a new SQL script (again, from the `File` menu)
* delete all the pre-populated lines of code, as follows: </br>![Pre-populated code in new SQL script](src/images/new_sql.png)
* to connect with our SQL db in memory, add the following line to the head of your SQL script:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
#| eval: false
-- !preview conn=src_memdb()$con
```

* finally, save your SQL script (any file name is fine)

## Getting started

Our db has one table, named `penguins`. A table is similar to an Excel sheet - a rectangular set of rows and columns containing our data. To preview our data, we'll need to write a first line of SQL. Please add the following to the bottom of your SQL script:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM penguins;
```

* SQL queries usually start with the `SELECT` keyword, which retrieves data from the database
* `*` means "show me everything!"
* `FROM penguins` specifies that we want everything from the penguins table. That specification is important, because most real-life SQL set-ups will have multiple tables of data
* `;` ends the line. Not essential, but good practice
* **Important:** press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` in the source code pane to run your SQL script

## Playing with that query

* We'll now change that one query to do something slightly different
* Unlike most other languages, you'll write SQL queries one at a time
* Add a new keyword `LIMIT 5` at the end of your query to produce a shorter preview of our data:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM penguins LIMIT 5;
```

* SQL is case insensitive - including for column names etc - but it's customary to use capitals for the keywords. It makes your SQL easier to read, too.

## Exercise
+ please could you modify your SQL statement to preview the first 10 rows of the data
:::


## SQL dialects

* SQL has been around for a [very long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), and has been used in lots of different ways
* That means there are several slightly different dialects of SQL which are (unfortunately) incompatible
* We'll largely ignore those differences in this beginner's training
* But, just to illustrate, the `LIMIT` keyword is one that only works in some types of SQL
* If you were using Microsoft's dialect of SQL, you'd need to write something slightly different:

```{sql}
#| eval: false
SELECT * TOP 5 from penguins;
```

* Or if you were using Oracle's newest dialect of SQL, you'd write either:

```{sql}
#| eval: false
SELECT * FROM penguins FETCH FIRST 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

* Or, an older - but possibly neater - way of writing Oracle SQL:

```{sql}
#| eval: false
SELECT * FROM penguins WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
```

## Comments

* If you want to turn off some of your SQL, or add notes, you can include comments
* `--` double-dash to comment a line, or part of a line
* `/*` and then `*/` slash-star to comment a multi-line chunk

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM penguins LIMIT 5; -- comment in the line

/* or a longer chunk
  古池や蛙飛び込む水の音
  ふるいけやかわずとびこむみずのおと
*/  
```

## Columns

* you can select some of your columns by changing the `SELECT *` keyword
    - the `*` we've been using so far is a wildcard, which shows all the columns in your table
* add column name(s) to retrieve just parts of your data

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT species, island FROM penguins;
```

+ note that columns are returned in the order you ask for them
+ you can also rename selected columns using `AS`:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT species, island AS landmass
    FROM penguins;
```

* note too that SQL is insensitive to whitespace, so you can generally split up longer queries over many lines
* an alternative strategy (if you're brave) is to use implicit renaming:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT island landmass FROM penguins;
```

:::{.callout-note collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Exercise
+ please select the `species` and `flipper_length_mm` columns with new names of your choice
:::


## Distinct values

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT DISTINCT species FROM penguins;
```

* `DISTINCT` gathers the unique values in a column, or unique combinations of values across multiple columns
* this second query gives you all the combinations of penguins and islands that exist in our data:
    
```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT DISTINCT island, species FROM penguins;
```


## Acknowledgements

Like all our courses and sessions, this is a team effort, and I thank the network as a whole for their encouragements and contributions. Specific thanks in this case go to Amanda King (NHS GGC), Steven Knapman (NHS Fife), and James McMahon (Public Health Scotland), and to the members of the pilot cohort for this session.
