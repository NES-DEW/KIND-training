## Session outline

+ this session is all about what happens **beyond the RCT**?
+ we'll recap some of the issues we discussed last time as motivation
+ then we'll introduce and discuss a pair of ways of summarising multiple RCTs
+ we'll relate these two methods back to our earlier discussions about bias
+ and we'll look at a totally different way of solving some of the problems of RCTs

## Recap

+ detecting treatment effects is hard
    + effects are subtle
    + trials have practical problems (like recruitment)
+ studies are often underpowered
    + so they fail to find a real treatment effect
+ that causes harm
    + some valuable treatments get ignored
    + some harmful treatments remain in use

## E1: the logo

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}

1. Please visit [https://www.cochrane.org/](https://www.cochrane.org/)
1. Two questions for the chat:
    1. What does Cochrane do?
    1. What does their logo show?

## Cochrane story

  ~name, ~ev.trt, ~n.trt, ~ev.ctrl, ~n.ctrl,
  "Auckland",     36L,   532L,      60L,    538L,
  "Block",      1L,    69L,       5L,     61L,
  "Doran",      4L,    81L,      11L,     63L,

```

## Forest plots

::: columns

:::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| message: false

steroid <- rmeta::meta.MH(n.trt, n.ctrl, ev.trt, ev.ctrl,
                   names=name, data=cochrane)
plot(steroid, col = rmeta::meta.colors("RoyalBlue"))

```
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

+ [useful intro](https://uk.cochrane.org/news/how-read-forest-plot)
+ one row per study
+ box size corresponds with study size (weight)
+ box location corresponds with odds ratio (OR)
+ whiskers (horizonal lines) showing the confidence interval of that OR
+ pooled effect show by the diamond
    + size = total weight
    + horizontal limits = confidence interval


::: {.notes}

1. how would you interpret the line representing a study crossing 1?
1. how can individual lines cross 1, but the pooled diamond not cross 1?

## E2: from 1982 to 2020

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}

1. Find the [current version of this Cochrane review](https://www.cochrane.org/news/featured-review-antenatal-corticosteroids-accelerating-fetal-lung-maturation-women-risk-preterm)
1. What are the main current recommendations?

## Current recommendations

#| echo: false
#| eval: true

```
## Cochrane reviews are systematic reviews

> A systematic review attempts to identify, appraise and synthesize all the empirical evidence that meets pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question ([Cochrane library](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/about/about-cochrane-reviews))

## Explicit strategies
+ like EBM itself
+ e.g. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ([PRISMA](http://www.prisma-statement.org/))

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nealhaddaway/PRISMA2020/master/inst/extdata/PRISMA.png")

```

# Meta-analysis

## What's the difference?

+ systematic reviews attempt to include **all** the relevant studies
+ meta-analyses include **some** relevant studies
+ that might give rise to biases...

### E3: bias and MA/SR

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}

1. [Some authors](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-07) argue that systematic reviews should generally be preferred to meta-analyses on the ground of bias. Can you think of biases that might affect MA, but not SR?
1. Can you think of different reasons why you might prefer a MA, rather than a SR?

+ undue influence of industry on drug research
+ **plus**
+ excessive emphasis on the methods of trials, rather than their conduct
+ **plus**
+ pressure to perform larger, cleaner, RCTs 
+ **produces**
+ a "murderous disaster" [@goldacre2012]

# Two kinds of validity

## Internal and external validity
+ MA/SR can improve **internal validity**
    + e.g. aggregating improves power, so more likely to detect true effects
+ but they might do this at the expense of reducing **external validity**
    + e.g. our trial population might be more and more unlike our treatment population
+ and reducing external validity might mean that an intervention might fail in ways that are hard to understand [@cartwright2012]

![](../src/images/05_exval.png){height=250}

## Trial and treatment populations

+ *wildly* dis-similar [@fortin2006]
+ co-morbidity example
    + a database of 980 general-practice patients were assessed against inclusion critera from 5 blood pressure RCTs
    + of eligible patients "89% to 100% had multiple chronic conditions"
        + mean numbers ranged from 5.5 ± 3.3 to 11.7 ± 5.3

## Pragmatic trials

![[@patsopoulos2011]](../src/images/05_prago.png)

## Final thought

+ so there isn't going to be a simple answer about where on the precise / pragmatic spectrum we should end up
    + it's an optimisation problem
+ as EBM started by stressing the importance of explicit/judicious/conscientious use of evidence, we should probably adopt similar standards for our decision making in general
    + explicit about the kind of q we're answering
    + judicious about the way we use evidence to answer it
    + conscientious in updating, revising, and checking our answers, and our methods
