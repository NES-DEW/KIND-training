## Welcome

-   this session is for üå∂üå∂ intermediate users with some prior experience of academic writing

## Session outline

-   how and why to reference?
  -   referencing styles
-   practice some referencing
-   and talk about sources of referencing data, and strategies for managing your references

## How to reference

-   if you use a source in a substantive way when writing, include a short and stereotyped mention of that source (aka a reference) 

## Why reference?

-   to show where an idea comes from - the scholarly breadcrumb trail
-   to fend off controversy when introducing difficult ideas
-   to save yourself work
-   to avoid allegations of impropriety

## Referencing styles

-   there are lots of different styles
-   no-one agrees which is best/correct/right
-   pedants delight in the details, and you will often see minor differences in style in different places. See the [narcissism of small differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences) - by and large, the details are irrelevant and pointless
-   clarity and consistency beats, by a long way, specific scheme trivia
-   if in doubt, ask two simple questions:

## The key questions

1. can you find your source from your reference?
1. are my references consistent across my work
  
### Vancouver (AMA)
  
-   each work is numbered by order of appearance
-   use that number in the text as your citation: `(2)`
-   ordered list of end-notes as your bibliography: 

> 2. O'Neil C. Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy. London: Allen Lane; 2016.

### Harvard

-   each work gets a unique author-year identifier
-   that identifier is used in the text as your citation: `(O'Neil, 2016)`
-   bibliography ordered by first-author surname and year: 

> O'Neil, Cathy. 2016. *Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy*. London: Allen Lane.

### Which to use?

#### Harvard

+ strengths
  + Allows pin-point referencing of single pages
  + Great when readers are likely to be familiar with some sources
  + Easy to troubleshoot
+ weaknesses
  + Verbose and distracting, particularly if you have lots of references in a single sentence - `(3-11)` rather than `(see Smith, 1901; Smith, 1902; Smith, 1903)`
  + Harder to create
    
#### Vancouver

+ strengths
  + Concise
  + Great for short papers with comparatively few references
+ weaknesses
  + Bad for per-page pinpoint references
  + Ungainly for longer documents
  + Edits might necessitate renumbering                                       
  
  
## Practical
  
  -   here are some resources:
  -   a [Knowledge Network link to a book](https://nhs.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NHSS_INST/1uf6iap/alma991000380938803491)
-   a link to a [concise Vancouver style guide from the University of Lancaster](https://lancaster.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=32561649)
-   a link to a [similar Harvard guide from Anglia Ruskin University](https://library.aru.ac.uk/referencing/files/QuickHarvardGuide2019.pdf)
-   please can you write a reference in both Vancouver and Harvard style?
  -   the in-text citation
-   the end-of-document reference

### Different types of source need different handling

-   here's [a link to a (famous) journal article](https://nhs.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NHSS_INST/nf660i/cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_81083111)
-   please could you repeat your referencing exercise using this different source?

## Referencing tools

### Word referencing

-   many people just typing in references manually at the foot of the document
-   this is probably the best way of working if you're dealing with a very few references (say, less than 10)
-   but there's an inflection point at about 10 references, where the manual approach gets horrid

### Word referencing how-to

-   you'll need the citation tools menu </br> ![citation tools](../src/images/clipboard-1235971876.png){height="100"}
-   add a reference by `Manage Sources` </br>![Adding a new source](../src/images/clipboard-91795603.png){height="200"}
-   select a reference style (APA is approximately Harvard)
-   add in-text citations with `Insert Citation`
-   add a bibliography with `Bibliography`

### Pros and cons of Word referencing

-   ‚úîÔ∏è quick and convenient
-   ‚úîÔ∏è uses a familiar tool
-   ‚ùå need to download dubious add-ons to change style
-   ‚ùå bibliographic data needs manually-entering, and is hard to re-use

## Refworks

-   [The Knowledge Network resources on Refworks](https://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/library-resources/refworks-and-reference-management/)

### Bibtex

-   FOSS- and code-friendly format for storing bibliographic data
-   [widely-interpretable](https://www.bibtex.org/)

```{}
@article{oneil2016, 
  author = "Cathy O'Neil", 
  Title = {Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy}, 
  publisher = "Allen Lane",
  city = "London",
  YEAR = 2016, 
} 
```

-   e.g. adding `[@oneil2016]` in Quarto generates a citation: [@oneil2016]
-   and we'll gain a bibliography at the end of the slides

### Pros and cons of bibtext

-   ‚úîÔ∏è powerful and flexible
-   ‚úîÔ∏è allows you to manage large bibliographies with big serious tools (like [JabRef](https://www.jabref.org/))
-   ‚ùå finding clean data is a challenge, and manual tidying is tedious
-   ‚ùå for the code-friendly, or code-curious

## Feedback and resources

- lots of decent, quick guides online
- if you really need chrome-plated precision about referencing:
    - [The Oxford Style Manual](https://nhs.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/44NHSS_INST/1uf6iap/alma990002428160203491)
    - [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html)
