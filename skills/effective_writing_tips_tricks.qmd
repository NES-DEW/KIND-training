## About this session

-   this session is about writing for analytical purposes
-   this is an intermediate-level session, so it's aimed at people with prior professional experience of analytical writing
-   it's largely hints-and-tips, rather than deeply philosophical
-   it's based on Paul J. Silva's excellent 2007 book [*How To Write A Lot*](https://search.worldcat.org/formats-editions/1031048252), with appropriate translations to non-academic writing
- it's also one of the rare training sessions with a single right answer: **schedule your writing**

## Writing is hard

- writing is hard
- but we also make writing much harder than it needs to be
- that makes writing unpleasant
- which produces poor results
- and there's a doom-loop: those self-inflicted worries make subsequent writing harder

## Writing is a teachable skill

-   understand what writing is
-   what you need to write
-   when to write
-   schedule, plan, and monitor
- keep the style simple

## What writing is
+ anything that gets the project done counts as writing
+ anything that doesn't, doesn't
+ that includes planning, scheduling, thinking, etc. Anything that ultimately leads to getting words on the page

## What you need to write
+ loads of utter bilge written about this, but basically two necessary components only:
  + time (we'll discuss below)
  + space
+ you probably can't fit a writing project into your current schedule without some readjustments

## I don't feel like writing

[Silva 2007: 25](https://search.worldcat.org/formats-editions/1031048252): you write three times as much if you schedule your writing time, and force yourself to write

## Schedule, plan, and monitor
* massive blocks of time are a trap (binge writing)
* what you need is a schedule: "the terrible power of habit"
* add a regular writing slot to your schedule:
  * do it it Teams
  * stick to it
  * don't give it up for anything
  * monitor your compliance
  
## What to do with your schedule?
1. figure out your project aim(s): each a single sentence that describes what the project needs to do
1. break those aims down into a plan
1. use the plan to give yourself concrete daily goals
1. monitor those goals and reward yourself for meeting them
  1. rewards can be anything except days off writing

## Concrete daily goals
+ write 50 words in section xxxx
+ plan section headings for xxxx
+ review data and plan maps for xxxx
+ write text around maps for xxxx
+ proof-read section xxxx

## More on planning
* we can usually find/steal a formula to work from by reading work with similar aims
* steal their structure and populate it to suit your project aim
+ get feedback on your plan 

## Recursive planning
+ take your project aim
+ you now need 3-5 points that:
    + support/explain/make up your main aim
    + each point should be a simple sentence
+ then repeat: 3-5 points for each point, and so on
    + you should almost certainly stop one layer of detail before you think you've said enough

## Write to the plan
+ write a horrible first draft
  + fill-in-the-blanks of your plan
  + don't sweat anything other than the main aim: does this work stick to the topic, and cover all the ground you need to
+ schedule time to re-work this draft into a second-draft
  + make it simple: prefer cutting rather than adding
  + put in into English
+ get feedback on that approximate second draft

## Push the message
+ you're definitely an expert
+ but your reader doesn't need to be an expert

and

+ you've worked for hours on this
+ but your reader skimmed

and

+ you know how each piece of the work will eventually fit into the work as a whole
+ but your reader doesn't

and

+ you think your graphs and tables speak for themselves
+ but your reader doesn't know the context, and doesn't understand what you're trying to show them

## Style tips
+ mind the technical jargon
  + minimise, standardise, and define
+ remove
  + the non-technical jargon
  + parasitic intensifiers (quite, totally, very, basically, completely, ...)
+ parallel sentences are excellent for analytics
  + "In the first group, something happened. In the second group, nothing happened."
  + "We did a thing. Those with cars responded. Those without cars did not."
  
## Collaborative complaining and support
+ use the KIND network
+ get a work collaborator
