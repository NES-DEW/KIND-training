## About this course

This course is designed to give you an introduction to thinking with data to understand aspects of health and care systems, regardless of their technical background.

The course focuses on using data to answer real questions about the services and systems you work in. Whether you want to understand how busy a service is, how things are changing, or what your local population needs, this course gives you the tools to explore those questions using information you can count and compare.

At the same time, data literacy is also about confidence: the confidence to ask questions, to notice when numbers do not add up, and to avoid having the wool pulled over your eyes by statistics used without context.

Across x weeks, we will cover how data is collected, how to organise it using tools like Excel, and how simple statistics help us summarise and compare information. We will work with real-world questions such as:

– Is our hospital busier than it was last year?
– Do we have proportionally more children than average in our town?
– How many people are currently homeless in Scotland?
– Are care home residents in our area experiencing more falls than in similar areas?

The course will run in a positive, supportive, and practical learning environment, with opportunities to learn from colleagues' experiences across services. Sessions are deliberately not recorded to create a space where people can ask questions openly and explore ideas without pressure.

By the end, you will be able to use data to provide clear, practical answers, understand the limitations of those answers, ask better questions, and communicate your findings confidently to others.


# Introducing data literacy 

What is data, and why would we think about it? In this session, we'll explore the idea that data is an especially powerful way of understanding how systems in health and care work. That means that data is an excellent way of asking some of the common questions about our work that we might like to answer. For example, we might want answer questions like:

* "is our hospital busier than it was last year?"
* "do we have proportionally more children than average in our town?"
* "how many people are currently homeless in Scotland"

While there are many possible ways of answering such questions, this course will concentrate on using data to provide answers. For example, we could find data that would help us answer the questions above. That might look like:

* a month-by-month count of patients visiting our hospital for the last two years
* census data, showing demographics of different towns in Scotland
* survey data estimating how many people are currently homeless nationally

Here, we'll think about data as **structured information, usually numerical, that tells us about part of a system**. 

This course will talk about several aspects of working with data. First, we'll talk about how data can be collected from systems. Thinking about our three example questions again, we could collect data by:

* adding up all the inpatient and outpatient appointments each month
* asking everyone in Scotland to complete a census return every few years
* requesting services supporting the homeless to estimate how many service users they see each week

We'll also talk about how to manage that data we've collected, by looking at some common tools (like Excel) that help manage data. That conversation about tools will then lead us to thinking about how to use statistics as a set of mathematical tools for helping us understand, summarise, and compare data that we've collected. Finally, we'll talk about how to take those statistics, and use them to do things. As we'll see, statistical summaries of data are especially helpful in helping us understand the systems we're working on. We'll look specifically at three areas where understanding is especially important: **explaining** how systems work, **predicting** what will happen as our system changes, and **controlling** the behaviour of that system.

Together, we'll describe this linked set of skills as **data literacy**, which describes a set of knowledge and skills across the data journey. That means that we'll think about data literacy as being made up of a a combination of:

* understanding how systems can be data-fied
* having some awareness of the tools and rules for gathering data
* knowing a bit about some statistical tools used to understand, summarise, and compare that data
* understanding some effective strategies for using this data (and statistics) as a basis for the explanation/prediction/control of systems, including how to communicate your findings to others
* finally, figuring out how to use that knowledge of what you want to do with your data to simplify and streamline other aspects of the data journey


# Data-fying systems

Or, an introduction to measurement

# Collecting data

Five-ish questions 
1. Where did this data come from?
1. What sort of data is it?
1. How is it relevant to what I'm doing?
1. Do we need to do this work anew, or is it already done?
1. What's wrong with this data
    1. Where are the gaps we can fill
    1. Where are the non-fillable gaps
    1. How might it need re-engineering?
1. How can I save someone time in future

Ignore storing data: that's too tech-dependent

Warnings about data collection

# Statistics

We've talked a lot about how to collect data from a system. In this session, we'll talk about some statistical tools for understanding what that data might mean. 

### Introduction

Imagine that we are measuring some numeric health or care value in an individual This could be, just for example:

+ height
+ blood pressure
+ number of years since retirement

Without knowing what's generally expected, the number by itself doesn't tell us anything very interesting. We need some context to make sense of an individual number. For values like blood pressure, we often have reference ranges that tell us what a normal blood pressure might be. For other values (like height, or number of years since retirement) we generally have some clear idea of what a normal number might be from our daily experience. 

Broadly, these ways of making sense of a value are about comparing a number to the normal expected range of that number. 

Imagine that we're data-fying some system, and (for reasons better left unexplored) decide to record the shoe sizes of our colleagues. We start with Susan, and rapidly discover that she wears a UK size 7. 

Here's the question: is that *good*? 

Without some kind of context for that number, we can't really make sense of what it means. So let's compare Susan's shoe size with all the other shoe sizes that we find in our organisation. Put together, and counted in groups, we might end up with a graph that looks like this:^[It's worth noting that this first example about shoe sizes uses deeply unrealistic data about how shoe sizes vary across the population. We'll look at some more true-to-life data later]

```{r}
# this code here is a little bit too advanced for this course, so hidden for now

uniform_data <- function(n, dof, range, val, name, varname) {
  
  data <- tibble(patient=1:n, val=sample(1:range, n, replace=T))
  
  if (dof > 1) {
    
  for(i in 1:(dof-1)) {
    data <- data %>% mutate(val=(val + sample(1:range, n, replace=T)))  
  }
    data <- data %>% mutate(val=(val / dof))
  }                      
  ggplot(data) +
  geom_bar(aes(val)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=val, color="#cc0000") +
  annotate("text", x=(val+(0.2)), y=0.5*(max(data %>% count(val))), label=paste0(name, "'s ", varname, " = ", val), angle=90, color="#cc0000") +
    xlab(paste0("Value of ", varname)) +
    ylab(paste0("Count of ", varname))
}

uniform_data(400, 1, 6, 7, "Susan", "shoe size")

```

This suggests that Susan's shoe size might be unusual and interesting, as it's higher than any of the other shoe sizes in our comparison group. For us, the gathering together of other shoe size data also build a really important statistical tool here (although it might not feel like it!). This graph showing how a value varies in a population is called the **empirical frequency distribution**. We'll explore this in the next section.

# Effective strategies

# Storytelling

## Session outline

1. why think about storytelling?
1. a warning about the analyst's pitfall
1. four principles for better data storytelling
1. a practical run-through of those principles

## Why think about storytelling?

* this is a session about some aspects of telling stories with data
* it's needed because:
  * bad graphs are everywhere
  * and everyone has an opinion about what makes good graphs
  
## Bad graphs are everywhere

+ [Yes](https://i.insider.com/51cb1bda6bb3f7d47800003b?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp)
+ [Ugly charts](https://flowingdata.com/category/visualization/ugly-visualization/)
+ [badvisualisations](https://www.tumblr.com/badvisualisations)

## Everyone has an opinion about how to improve graphs

::: {.notes}
+ if you're a data viz person, or want to be one, you should read all of those (and more). You'll need all the details.
+ the rest of us can go a very long way with four simple storytelling principles
+ this session will look at these rules as applied to graphs. You could apply them to other areas of your work
:::

## The analyst's pitfall

+ Doing a piece of analysis gives you an odd perspective on an issue:
  + time served
  + starting expertise
  + power of details

::: {.notes}
+ Two cases:
  + How long did your last project take to create?
  + How long did you spend reading the last project report/dashboard/statistical output that you read?
  
+ you understand and know the bones of the project. You're driven by details.
+ your reader doesn't. The details are a barrier.

+ beware the comforting fallacy of including all the information for the sake of precision: it's a category mistake

+ you need to know it all, too: the domain knowledge is important

## On exactitude in science

> ...In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.



## Four principles

+ Be obvious, and know what you want to say
+ Be explicit, and make that point directly to your audience
+ Be simple, and select the telling details
+ Be concise, and omit everything else


## Be obvious 

Know what you want to say

## Be obvious 

* most data sets can support lots of different conclusions
* it's your job to decide which conclusion a reader should draw
  * your knowledge of the data is key
  * lots of planning/storyboarding
  * lots of trying to boil down complicated data into simple stories

## Be explicit
Know your audience, and speak directly to them

. . .

* different groups will have different needs
  * communicating with other KIND people will present different demands to talking to managers
* correct choice of graph


## Perceptual ranking

## Chart-selection advice

* change over time = line
* comparing quantities between times or places = column
* counting groups = histogram/density plot
* comparing groups across categories = something stacked

## Be simple
Select the telling details for your reader

* highlight the details right on the graph: don't leave a reader to guess what your point is
* add annotations and titles telling us what the point of the graph is



## Be concise
Omit everything else (Tufte fans would call this chartjunk)

* random colours / rainbow graphs break conciseness
* grid lines, background colours, 
* unless it helps tell the story



## What's the obvious point here?

+ horrible trick question: there isn't one
+ we could tell hundreds of different stories with this data
+ breakouts: a once-sentence idea about what to **do** with this data

## How to be explicit about that?

## How to be simple about that?

## How to be concise




# Constraining your system

# What are we avoiding?

* qualitative
