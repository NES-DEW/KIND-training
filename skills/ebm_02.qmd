## Session outline

+ this session is about the randomized control trial (RCT)
+ the results of RCTs are particularly important in EBM
+ we'll do a bit of historical work here to show how the RCT developed
+ and we'll identify how key features of RCTs guard against some common errors in medical evidence
+ we'll also look at some ways that RCTs might conceal errors - they're certainly not perfect!

## Exercises

-   E1: control in the streptomycin trial
-   E2: would you take the treatment?
-   E3: the rules of an RCT
-   E4: cheat your way through a drug trial

# Introduction: James Lind and clinical trials

## Another big sentence

> Because the randomised trial...is so much more likely to inform us and so much less likely to mislead us, it has become the “gold standard” for judging whether a treatment does more good than harm.”
[@sackett1996]

## Lind

## Clinical trials
+ clinical trial = test of a healthcare intervention
+ clinical trials are nothing new:
    + James Lind's anti-scorbotic treatments [@hughes1975]
    + Fibiger's serum diptheria treatment [@hrobjartsson1998]
    + and lots of similar examples of clinical trials [@clarke1996]
+ perhaps surprisingly, clinical trials have been controversial...

## Testing and doing harm

+ it's hard to show benefits without causing harm
    + showing inferiority = causing harm
+ we usually seek to avoid harms wherever possible
    + different ethical frameworks for research and treatment
+ we're in an uncomfortable space of justifying individual harm by group benefits
    + and there are too many examples where human rights abuses and scientific research have overlapped

## It's also remarkably hard to find out whether treatments work
![It's hard to find out whether trials work](../src/images/02_streto-rationale.png)

## It's also remarkably hard to find out whether treatments work
+ as well as the ethical issue, we also have an epistemological issue
    + people and diseases vary
    + treatments often make small differences to outcomes
    + multifactorial models of outcomes
    + measurements are imperfect
    + vested interests are powerful
    + ...

## Ethics + epistemology give rise to strong demands on clinical trials

+ ethical concerns (and others) suggest that we should be careful when designing clinical research
+ otherwise the harm done to trial participants is just harm
    + we need to find things out properly to obtain benefits
    + this is why we want to minimise biases

# The 1948 streptomycin trial

## MRC 1948 as an example
+ @streptom1948
+ deals with treatment for a serious illness (TB) - there's some useful context about what the general landscape of TB was like 75 years ago in @bastian2006
+ very careful design, and reporting of that design
+ [interesting data viz](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2091872/?page=11) - and some context for the trial itself in @crofton2006

## E1: control in the streptomycin trial

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
+ look at the [first two pages of the 1948 streptomycin trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2091872/pdf/brmedj03701-0007.pdf)
+ please identify some control strategies used by the trial authors
:::

## Control strategies

+ standardising the trial population
+ controlling which treatment was used
+ random allocation to S- or C-group
+ masking
+ standardised assessment
+ following-up patients comprehensively
+ statistical analysis

## E2: would you take the treatment?

# Generic RCT method

## The heart of RCTs

![RCT method](../src/images/02_RCT.png)

## E3: the rules of an RCT
+ hopefully the last two examples give you a sense of some of the 'rules' of an RCT
    + some rules about conduct
    + some rules about reporting


::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
+ open [the JamBoard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/13neYMtzsLOYz2BgP8aaNgVYpHESMJoW8jJ1AAMGoPmw/edit?usp=sharing)
+ let's build a set of rules for RCTs
:::

## A note on randomising
- why do we randomise patients to groups?
- what might happen if we did not randomise?
- how could we randomise patients to groups?

## E4: cheat your way through a drug trial

+ imagine that you wanted to promote a new, but ineffective, drug (call it *spurosium*) - [@lundh2017]
+ how could you bend these RCT rules?
     + how could we guard against these rules being bent?
     + how could you detect someone trying to bend the rules?

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
+ add your thoughts to the [the JamBoard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/13neYMtzsLOYz2BgP8aaNgVYpHESMJoW8jJ1AAMGoPmw/edit?usp=sharing)
:::

## A final thought

+ RCTs are a really important source of E in EBM - but not the only one [@jefferson2018]
+ we'll encounter many kinds of evidence 
    + systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other guidelines are increasingly important
    + there are many instances where we're unable to perform RCTs
    + there are also many flawed RCTs out there
+ that means that we'll need a proper method for finding and using evidence
    + it's more complicated than "find a relevant RCT and act on it"
+ that's for next week...
    + you might like to have a [look at the core text for next time](https://nhs-scot-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/3dhhck/44NHSS_ALMA5146749970003491)
