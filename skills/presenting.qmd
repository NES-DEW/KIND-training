## Who is this session for?

:::{.callout-important collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}
## Please note
+ you will need to do a little bit of presenting during the session
:::

+ it's a beginner's session, so it's aimed at people:
    + who don't do much presenting, or who have never presented before
    + or who have had negative experiences of presenting
    + or would like to improve their presentation skills, but don't know where to start
+ it's practical, so we'll do a mixture of strategy and practice during the session

## Session outline

+ why think about presentation skills?
+ a minimal set of advice
+ an opportunity to practice
+ additional advice, questions, and chatter

## A note about trust
+ most of us find presenting hard
+ in this session, please be gentle:
    + don't mock or undermine
    + don't play devil's advocate
    + give people time
+ expressly, don't record any of this session in any way

## Why think about presentation skills?
+ possibly the ultimate in transferable skills
+ most people are terrible at presenting
    + presenting differs from listening in non-obvious ways
+ but you can improve easily and cheaply

## A minimal set of advice

1. Be simple
1. Be keen
1. Be human


## Be simple
+ if in doubt, take it out

### Why be simple?

+ the asymmetry of presentation:        
    + you'll know much more than your audience
    + so you'll worry about details, not basics
    + but your audience will need the basics, not the details
+ simple = clear

### How to be simple?

+ apply a hierarchy
+ recursive planning
+ use your constraints

### The hierarchy
+ you'll need a single sentence that sums up your presentation
    + everything else comes from this
+ ideally you'll have it in mind before you start
    + but it often changes
+ this is non-negotiable, and much harder than it looks

### Task: make a sentence
+ you're going to present something you did this week at work
+ can you sum it up in one sentence?
    +  that's your [win of the week](https://forms.office.com/e/8DgpNP6rcK) sentence too
+ several example prompts
    + "What's most important?"
    + "What's most interesting?"
    + "what needs fixing?"
    + ...
    
### Recursive planning
+ you now need 3-5 points that:
    + support/explain/make up your main point
    + each point should be a simple sentence
+ then repeat: 3-5 points for each point, and so on
    + you should almost certainly stop one layer of detail before you think you've said enough

### Task: support your sentence

+ "I managed to fix my booking system"
    + "booking clinic slots was done manually"
    + "that was slow and error-prone"
    + "I used PowerAutomate + very strong language to automate it"
    + "I had to learn to use `Apply to Each` to get that to work"
    + "I am now thinking about automating my other clinic bookings"
    
### Constraints
+ take your plan, and chop it down to size by considering:
    + how long do you have to speak, exactly?
        + one point every two minutes is pretty good going
    + how long do you have to prepare?
        + see below...
    + who are your audience?
        + the less closely they're related to your work, the less material you're going to cover
    + how big is the audience?
        + bigger = messier = less detail

### Tech
+ it's hard to give general advice, but think carefully about your specific tech
+ tech often malfunctions during presentations, so you might have a backup (e.g. what to do if you can't show your slides?)
+ you'll also be more likely to make mistakes with the tech when speaking

## Be keen
+ enthusiasm for your work, for your audience, and for what you're presenting about is the easiest way to come off as knowledgeable and interesting
+ plenty of preparation helps
+ but for most of us this is scary
+ fake it with socially-approved cheating!
    + excited vs scared
    + smile, eye contact, and a bit of hand gesturing
    + build yourself a few lines to say at the start. Introductions work well. Don't be afraid of being blunt!
    + give yourself a sentence in and out of each slide/section
    + build yourself some go-tos if you get stuck or the tech explodes

### Practice time!

+ we'll work in pairs
+ you've got a sentence, and 3-5 supporting bits
+ we're going to get you to present for **two minutes** only, no visual aids - just chat
+ we'll pause here to let everyone put their sentences in order 
+ then into pairs:
    + one minute to find your feet
    + two minutes presenting
    + one minute of gentle, constructive, and positive feedback
    + then swap

### Prep time

+ if you're new at this, or it's important, I would budget a **huge** amount of time to prepare
    + one hour preparation per minute of speaking (seriously)
+ this time isn't for doing the work you're presenting
    + it's just for planning the presentation
+ beware procrastination by optimization (especially making slides before you've decided what you're going to say)

### Slides

+ recursive plan + pictures = slides
+ fewer than 20 words per slide
+ usual advice is 2 minutes per slide
+ put your details at the start and end

## Be human

+ don't try and cover everything
+ absolutely leave time for Q+A (and ideally a bit of random chat) at the end
+ don't apologise, but do admit when things go wrong
    + there's asymmetry here too: your clunker will look like a mini-hitch to the audience

### Make it easy for yourself
