## About this session

This session is all about getting data into, and out of SQL. We'll look at:

* adding data to an existing table, either row-by-row, or at larger scale
* discussing how to update data, including adding, removing, and renaming columns
* and showing how to create new tables

## Setup 

* You will need a free [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/) account. Please set this up and check that you have access before the session begins
* Once you've logged-in to [posit.cloud](https://posit.cloud/), please create a new Rstudio project </br>![New Rstudio project](src/images/sql_intro_create_project.png)
* In that project, create a new R script: </br>![Create a new R script from the file menu](src/images/sql_intro_create_script.png)

* Copy and paste the following R code into that script:

```{r r-script}
#| eval: false

## install and attach R packages
pkg <- c("dbplyr", "RSQLite", "palmerpenguins")
install.packages(setdiff(pkg, rownames(installed.packages())))  

library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

conn <- src_memdb() # create an sqlite db in memory
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

conn <- src_memdb() # create an sqlite db in memory
```

* save your script and click the `Source` button
    * that will create a simple SQL database in memory
* now create a new SQL script (again, from the `File` menu)
* delete all the pre-populated lines of code, as follows: </br>![Pre-populated code in new SQL script](src/images/new_sql.png)
* to connect with our SQL db in memory, add the following line to the head of your SQL script:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
#| eval: false
-- !preview conn=src_memdb()$con
```

* finally, save your SQL script (any file name is fine)

## Getting started

+ in this session, unlike the previous one, we'll start with an empty SQL database
+ we'll create a table in that db, and add some data to it

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
CREATE TABLE clients (chi varchar(10) NOT NULL,
                      name varchar(255),
                      birthdate date,
                      PRIMARY KEY (chi));
```

what's a table? the container for some data

need to set data types - SQL is typed

| type    | what                |
| ----    | ----                |
| CHAR    | fixed length char   |
| VARCHAR | variable length char|
| INT     | whole number        |
| DOUBLE  | decimal number      |
| DATE    | date                |
| DATETIME| date-time           | 

then test:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

should be empty, that's just fine for now. Let's add some data to that table to make it more useful:


## Adding data

insert data into your table using the `INSERT INTO` keyword:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
INSERT INTO clients VALUES ("1204851425", "Mr Odds", "1985-04-12");
```

and then check:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

It's good practice to specify the columns by name, especially if you need to include partial data:
```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
INSERT INTO clients (chi, birthdate) VALUES ("0701720842", "1972-01-07");
```

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Primary keys

+ when we wrote `PRIMARY KEY (chi)` while creating our table, we made the chi column special: this is the primary key of the table lives
+ primary keys are unique: they identify the distinct rows of the table
+ your SQL will fall over if you try and repeat chi values


## Adding multiple rows of data

+ largely just a matter of chaining to gether multiple sets of values
```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
INSERT INTO clients VALUES 
  ("0411016548", "The Moog", "2001-11-04"),
  ("3003627534", "One McIrey", "1962-03-30"),
  ("2407864568", "Dr Stamps", "1986-07-24");
```


```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Updating

+ one of our clients has no name...

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
UPDATE clients
  SET name = "David Lemon"
  WHERE chi = "0701720842"
```

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Adding cols

+ let's add some extra columns:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
ALTER TABLE clients ADD length INT(2);
```

+ we can set a single value for this new column
```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
UPDATE clients
  SET length = (10)
  
```

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
#| echo: false
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

+ setting individual values is much more messy:

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
UPDATE clients
  SET length = 12
  WHERE name = "Mr Odds" OR name = "Dr Stamps"
```


```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
#| echo: false
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Remove a column

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
ALTER TABLE clients DROP length;
```


```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}
#| echo: false
SELECT * FROM clients;
```

## Renaming cols

+ not as easy as might be liked, and highly dialect-y

## Note about uploading

+ depends on your local system, no generic SQL advice
+ refer to the R and SQL session

## Create tables

+ most real-life SQL projects are multi-table
+ we'll explore this in more detail in the joins session
+ but as an introduction, creating additional tables is exactly the same as creating a first table

```{sql connection=src_memdb()$con}

CREATE TABLE gps (chi varchar(10) NOT NULL,
                      gp varchar(255),
                      PRIMARY KEY (chi));
                      
INSERT INTO gps VALUES 
  ("1204851425", "Dr Smith"),
  ("0701720842", "Dr Patel"),
  ("0411016548", "Dr Hamoda"),
  ("3003627534", "Dr Clarke"),
  ("2407864568", "Dr Johal");
  
SELECT * FROM gps;
```
