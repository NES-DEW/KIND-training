## Session outline

This session aims to introduce the theory and practice of evidence-based health and care practice.

-   we'll begin with a simple introduction to evidence-based medicine (EBM)
-   we'll then work through a series of exercises
    -   to show both the problems that EBM solves, and the methods it uses to solve them
-   we'll introduce a mini-guide to finding, appraising, and reading a paper
    -   then taking what you've learned, and making a decision
-   then we'll set up a core EBM topic: the ranking of evidence
-   and we'll finish by looking at the wider EB\* family, of which EBM is just one member

## Exercises

-   E1: find a paper
-   E2: the EBM way
-   E3: bias, confounding, and effect sizes
-   E4: a mini-appraisal
-   E5: your EB\*

# Introduction

## The sentence

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the:

> "conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients" [@sackett1996]

## Meaning?

EBM as a set of standards for making decisions in medicine:

-   **conscientious**: using evidence wherever possible
-   **explicit**: naming the evidence that you've relied on to make a decision
-   **judicious**: applying standards to judge that evidence

## EBM's domain

-   clinical
-   individual care
-   "current best"

## The half-life of facts

# Finding papers

## E1: find a paper

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   go to the [Knowledge Network](http://www.knowledge.scot.nhs.uk/home.aspx) home page
-   find a paper about your area of work
-   spend three minutes having a look at the paper
-   please share one conclusion / takeaway from it in the chat
:::

## The takeaway from E1: papers are hard!

-   it's often not very obvious how a paper should change our practice
    -   complicated, poorly written, annoying...
    -   fallible
    -   excessively abstract
    -   deal with unfamiliar problems
    -   make many suggestions

# Appraising papers

## The sentence

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is the:

> "conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients" [@sackett1996]

Reacting against **non-systematic approaches** to using evidence to make decisions

## EBM methods give us a system for using evidence to make decisiosn

-   having a system simplifies that journey from evidence to decision
-   picking out which research we can trust
-   showing us which conclusions we should incorporate into our practice
-   subtly, suggesting that we go from decision to evidence, rather than absorbing all the evidence then making decisions

## E2: the EBM way

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   please reflect on the reasons that you might trust or distrust the paper that you found in E1
-   please put a reason to trust the paper, and a reason to distrust it, into the chat
:::

## Narrowing the scope of inquiry

-   methods
    -   was the trial randomised?
    -   were the pre-trial groups similar?
    -   apart from treatment, were the groups treated similarly?
    -   was anyone lost to follow-up?
    -   was there appropriate masking?
-   effect
    -   how large was the effect?
    -   how precisely was the effect measured?
-   relevance
    -   are the results relevant to my practice?

# Ranking of evidence

## Three central concerns in EBM

-   bias
-   confounding
-   effect sizes

## Bias in general is boring

-   AKA "systematic error"

> "We define bias as...deviation from the truth" [@cochrane2023]

## Specific biases are fascinating

![[@sackett1979]](../src/images/01_bias.png)

## Specific biases are fascinating

-   [CEBM's catalogue of biases](https://catalogofbias.org/biases)
-   EBM in very broad terms tries to minimise important biases

## Confounding is probably the most important bias

## E3: bias, confounding, and effect sizes

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   take a look at this plot of coronary artery disease rates: </br>![CHD rates](../src/images/01_conf_example.png)
-   what type of plot is this?
-   how would you explain the main finding here in simple terms?
-   what might explain the difference between the two groups?

## Guarding against bias through judgement

-   the core EBM methods are specifically designed to guard against bias and confounding
    -   randomisation ensures that different groups are comparable
    -   masking ensures fair measurement of effects
    -   reporting how individuals were followed-up prevents distorting results
-   also provide a standard set of tools for expressing effect sizes
    -   for instance, the use of confidence intervals
-   we'll do this **conscientiously** by appraising each piece of evidence in the same way

# The appraisal

## E4: a mini-appraisal

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   open the [Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine RCT Critical Appraisal Sheet](https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/files/ebm-tools/rct.pdf)
-   spend three minutes reading through
-   please re-report a finding from the paper from E1 using the critical appraisal sheet - put your finding in the chat
:::

## From appraisal to ranking

-   because EBM introduced methods for appraising evidence, this gave rise to a ranking of kinds of evidence</br>![EBM pyramid](../src/images/01_pyramid.png)
-   that ranking of evidence will be a core topic for us in session 3

## Beyond the care of the individual patient

-   EBM originally was about making individual clinical decisions about treatment from published research evidence
-   that scope has widened enormously over the past 30 years:
    -   to non-clinical domains of practice
    -   to guide the management of groups rather than individuals
    -   to support decisions about non-treatment questions
    -   to encompass other types of evidence

## E5: your EB\*

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   in the chat, please give us a few words on these two questions:

1.  where can you see the conscientious, judicious, and explicit use of current best evidence in your practice?
2.  are there any areas of your practice that are not evidence-based in this way?
:::

## Beyond the individual paper

-   just as the scope of EBM has changed over time, we'll also see how the methods of EBM have changed too
    -   part of that reflects the widening of scope
    -   part of that is down to changes in publication practices
    -   part of that is down to changes in methodological emphasis

. . .

::: callout-warning
This means that very different practices have flown under the EBM banner at different times and in different places. To avoid contradictions, we'll endorse a single coherent set of recommendations in this course, drawn from @Greenhalgh2019.

## ...and beyond **the** sentence

> Evidence-Based Medicine is the integration of best research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values.

## Next time!

-   in the next session, we'll look specifically at the most important trial methodology: the randomised control trial
-   that will set us up to think more carefully about bias and confounding, particularly as they relate to published evidence
-   that will set us up nicely for the next-*next* session, which is about the core EBM approach in
