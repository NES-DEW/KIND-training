That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:\n\n+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)\n+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) \n+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd) (this session)\n+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd)\n+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)\n+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)\t\t\n\nTogether, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers references and names in Excel:\n\n![Skills tree for beginner-level Excel](images/clipboard-4090026779.png)\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n  \n## Previous attendees have said...  \n  \n- 38 previous attendees have left feedback\n- 97% would recommend this session to a colleague\n- 92% said that this session was pitched correctly  \n\n  \n![](references_and_names_in_excel_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='left' width=288}  \n  \n:::{.callout-note}  \n### Three random comments from previous attendees  \n- Very helpful.  I used Excel for years and even have ECDL but through the training session I learned new things.\n- I thought the session was very clear and useful. Great way to learn Excel functions.\n- Brilliant, responsive to the questions and covered what was needed\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Some sample data\n\n| user   | DoB        | visit_date | service     |\n|--------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Steve  | 12/11/1984 | 26/04/2024 | podiatry    |\n| Emma   | 05/06/1999 | 24/05/2024 | respiratory |\n| Bhavin | 11/04/1976 | 23/04/2024 | dietetics   |\n\n## References\n\n-   Excel sheets are made up of cells\n-   cells are arranged in rows and columns\n    -   columns have letters - like `C`\n    -   rows have numbers - like `3`\n-   references are the 'address' of a particular cell - like `C3`\n    -   you can 'point' at a cell by using its reference\n\n## Finding a reference\n\n-   from the **name box**: </br> ![Name box](images/clipboard-1746127255.png)\n-   or work out from the column and row labels\n    -   always column letter, then row number\n    -   **C3**, not **3C**\n\n## Using a reference\n\n-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell\n-   formulas start with an `=`\n-   so we'll use `= C3` to get Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)\n\n## References in formulas\n\n-   we use references to allow us to pass data around our spreadsheet\n-   an example: how long ago was the service visit?\n-   calculate the number of days since the last visit with `= C3 - TODAY()`\n\n## References move\n\n-   by default, Excel references are **relative**\n-   when you move a reference, the cell that reference points to also moves </br> ![References are relative](images/clipboard-754991469.png){width=\"200\"}\n-   it is possible to 'fix' references\n    -   we call these **absolute** references\n    -   the `$` fixes a reference, so `$C$3` is absolute\n\n## You can name things\n\n-   almost everything in Excel can be named\n-   the easy way to start with that is using the **name box**\n-   names can replace references in formulas\n-   this is valuable when things get more complicated\n\n## You can use and manage names\n\n-   via the **Name manager** (`Ctrl` + `F3`)\n-   **Go to** (`F5`)\n\n# Practical\n\n## Using a reference\n\n-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n-   go to an empty cell, type `= C3`, and press `Enter/‚èé`\n-   that cell should now have Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)\n:::\n\n## References in formulas\n\n-   how long ago was the service visit?\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n## Task\n\n-   add a new column called last_visit\n-   in cell `E2`, add the following formula: `= TODAY() - C2`\n    -   that calculates the number of days since the last visit\n    -   you may need to correct the formatting </br> ![correct the formatting if needed](images/clipboard-2200716982.png){height=\"200\"}\n-   then copy/fill down\n:::\n\n## References move\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n## Task\n\n-   try copying your new block of last_visit cells around your sheet\n-   their value should change\n-   now try clicking those cells to see where the updated reference points to </br> ![where does the updated reference point to?](images/clipboard-754991469.png)\n:::\n\n## Absolute references\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n## Task\n\n-   delete your copied blocks of cells from the last step\n-   now update your references by adding `$` before the letter and number\n    -   so `C2` becomes `$C$2`\n    -   you might prefer to press `F4` instead\n-   now copy and paste those blocks of cells again. What's different this time?\n-   please delete those new blocks of cells when you're finished\n:::\n\n## You can name things\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n## Task\n\n-   let's average the last_visit column\n-   in a new cell (`G2` perhaps?) add this formula:\n    -   `=AVERAGE(E2, E3, E4)`\n-   now name that new cell `av_length` and try using it in a formula\n    -   `= INT(av_length)` would round that to the nearest day\n    -   `= E2 / av_length` would give you the percentage of average\n:::\n\n## You can manage those names\n\n::: {.callout-tip appearance=\"default\" icon=\"true\"}\n## Task\n\n-   find the **Name manager** (or press `Ctrl` + `F3`) </br> ![Name manager](images/clipboard-3382288451.png)\n-   try renaming your `av_length` cell\n-   try making a new named **range** from your three `last_visit` cells\n-   try using the `F5` Go to interface to navigate between your named cells\n:::\n",
