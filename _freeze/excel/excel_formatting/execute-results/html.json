I hate my formatting!\n\n-   `Clear` \\> `Clear Formats` (or `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F`) </br>![Clear Formats](images/clipboard-2778290463.png)\n-   note this doesn't clear out all the formatting from themes - especially odd fonts etc\n-   also worth having the `Paste as Values` trick in your back pocket for when things go horribly wrong </br>![Copy and paste](images/clipboard-2009747898.png){height=\"200\"} ![Then select Paste as Values to remove everything but the values themselves](images/clipboard-1815980106.png)\n\n## Number formatting\n\n- number formatting is taking a value, and changing its meaning with formatting\n- number formatting is how dates work (or fail to work) in Excel\n- dates are v. important, so we'll concentrate on them in this part of the session\n- you'll also encounter number formatting when working with...\n    -   money\n    -   percentages\n    -   decimal places\n    -   ...\n\n## Date formatting\n\n-   we'll take a number, and apply special formatting to it to make it look like a date\n    -   so `45483` will become `10/07/2024`\n-   Excel dates are stored as the number of days since Jan 1st 1900\n-   you can prove this to yourself by typing `1` into a cell, then formatting it as a date using the number formatting menu: </br>![Formatting 1 as a date](images/clipboard-4127875250.png){height=\"300\"}\n-   you can also format as a date via the Format Cells dialogue (`Ctrl` + `1`)\n\n## Don't try and cheat with dates!\n\n-   date formatting is one of the commonest pain points in Excel\n- dates are extremely complicated, and we often want to calculate with them\n-   the advice is simple: dates should always be stored as these numbers, and then formatted to look like dates\n    - don't try to cheat by writing dates as text\n    - use formatting to produce your preferred date format in the  Format Cells tools instead </br>![Format Cells](images/clipboard-1573227329.png){height=\"200\"}\n\n## Formatting vs other things\n\n(or, keep your sheets clean)\n\n-   it's common to see Excel sheets that contain lots of extraneous bits\n    -   headers, copyright info, explanations...\n-   ideally, all this extra stuff should be kept well away from your data, as it makes it harder to process that data safely\n-   ...and you should definitely be using tables to help with this\n\n## Conditional formatting\n\n-   this can get complicated, and we'll revisit more fancy conditional formatting in the intermediate training sessions\n-   the big idea is that conditional formatting alters the format as values change\n\n## Progress bars\n-   Put a few random numbers in a column ![Put a few random numbers in a column](images/clipboard-1315843620.png){height=\"100\"}\n\n-   Select them, and go to the Conditional Formatting menu ![go to the Conditional Formatting menu](images/clipboard-867757489.png){height=\"50\"}\n\n-   Select Data Bars </br>![Select Data Bars](images/clipboard-83873237.png){height=\"300\"}\n\n## Duplicate values\n-   Now clear that conditional formatting </br>![Clear conditional formatting](images/clipboard-199897657.png){height=\"300\"}\n-   Add a duplicate value to your numbers </br> ![Add a duplicate value to your numbers](images/clipboard-3663616570.png){height=\"150\"}\n\n## Duplicate values\n-   Highlight duplicate values </br>![Highlight duplicate values](images/clipboard-3254436237.png)\n\n## Red-Amber-Green reporting\n-   RAG reporting with icon sets </br>![RAG reporting with icon sets](images/clipboard-2465658889.png)\n\n## Key shortcuts\n\n-   `Ctrl` + `1` for the Format Cells dialogue\n-   `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F` to clear formats\n-   `Ctrl` + `v`, `Ctrl`, `v` to paste values only\n\n## Formatting tips\n\n-   Accessibility is much more important than beauty\n-   Use number formatting for dates, currency, percentages\n-   Consider using validation to make sure that cells only contain what you expect them to contain\n-   Consider locking cells to protect formatting when that formatting is really important\n-   Use conditional formatting sparingly\n",
