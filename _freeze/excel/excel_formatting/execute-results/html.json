That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:\n\n+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)\n+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) \n+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)\n+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd) (this session)\n+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)\n+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)\t\t\n\nTogether, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers formatting in Excel:\n\n![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-4054981329.png)\n\n-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files)\n-   you'll also need to be familiar with A1 referencing, values, and tables\n-   we're going to avoid talking about formulas as much as possible today\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n  \n## Previous attendees have said...  \n  \n- 83 previous attendees have left feedback\n- 98% would recommend this session to a colleague\n- 96% said that this session was pitched correctly  \n\n  \n![](excel_formatting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='left' width=288}  \n  \n:::{.callout-note}  \n### Three random comments from previous attendees  \n- It was a useful session, covering the basics of formatting in excel and highlighting some potential pitfalls. It's also helped me realise that I am much more advanced (at least in some areas of excel) than I'd previously thought. A good introduction to formatting for those that are either relatively new to excel or formatting.\n- very useful - picked up some tips\n- I don't know much about excel and was unsure what level of course to attend. I picked up a couple of basic tips. Attending this session was helpful for me to know what level of course to attend in future.\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n:::{.callout-note collapse=false appearance='default' icon=true}\n## Session materials\n+ [all materials {{< iconify ph:file-zip size=2x >}}](src/excel_formatting.zip)\n+ slides [{{< iconify ph:file-html size=2x >}} html](src/excel_formatting.html) / [{{< iconify ph:file-pdf size=2x >}} pdf](src/excel_formatting.pdf)\n:::\n\n\n## Session outline\n\n(thanks Deborah Calvin, Brian Orpin, Michael Roarty, Kenneth Mack, Catherine McGrenera, June Livey, Catriona Scott)\n\n-   accessibility\n-   formatting cells\n-   formatting values (aka **number formatting**)\n-   formatting vs other things\n-   shortcuts and tips\n-   an introduction to conditional formatting\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   many of us will have legal duties to make parts of our services accessible\n    -   e.g. [The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made)\n-   there are [useful standards for making sense of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)\n\n## Excel is a mixed bag for accessibility\n\n-   it is easy to make non-accessible documents in Excel\n    -   merged and split cells\n    -   inconsistent use of tables\n    -   poor column headings, sheet names, etc\n    -   unlabelled charts\n    -   low-contrast themes\n    -   meaning conveyed by colour and fonts\n-   there is a [built-in accessibility checker in some versions of Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/accessibility-best-practices-with-excel-spreadsheets-6cc05fc5-1314-48b5-8eb3-683e49b3e593), which you might find useful\n\n## Formatting cells\n\n-   please create a new Excel workbook\n-   you can format each cell individually via the right click menu and `Format cells` (or by the `Ctrl` + `1` shortcut) </br>![Format cells](images/clipboard-4055118942.png){height=\"400\"}\n\n## Format cells dialogue\n\n![Format cells dialogue](images/clipboard-2783553285.png){height=\"150\"}\n\n-   you can fill cells with custom fonts, alignments, colours, patterns, and gradients (via `Fill Effects...`)\n-   you can add borders to individual cells\n\n## Formatting many cells\n\n-   this is fine for a few cells, but gets boring (and inconsistent) if you have lots of styling to do\n-   you can select several cells, and access the `Format cells dialogue` to style them together\n-   or you can select a cell with a theme you want to copy, and use the `Format Painter` tool to spread that format about the place </br> ![Format Painter](images/clipboard-1122732356.png)\n\n## Theming\n\n-   you can also **theme** your whole workbook </br> ![theme your whole workbook](images/clipboard-3790842491.png)\n-   take care, though, as many of these themes are not accessible and often produce hard-to-read results\n-   and lots of ugly clunky stuff to find (e.g. default font changes)\n-   on balance, better to avoid themes unless you're certain they'll be of benefit for you\n\n## Help! I hate my formatting!\n\n-   `Clear` \\> `Clear Formats` (or `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F`) </br>![Clear Formats](images/clipboard-2778290463.png)\n-   note this doesn't clear out all the formatting from themes - especially odd fonts etc\n-   also worth having the `Paste as Values` trick in your back pocket for when things go horribly wrong </br>![Copy and paste](images/clipboard-2009747898.png){height=\"200\"} ![Then select Paste as Values to remove everything but the values themselves](images/clipboard-1815980106.png)\n\n## Number formatting\n\n- number formatting is taking a value, and changing its meaning with formatting\n- number formatting is how dates work (or fail to work) in Excel\n- dates are v. important, so we'll concentrate on them in this part of the session\n- you'll also encounter number formatting when working with...\n    -   money\n    -   percentages\n    -   decimal places\n    -   ...\n\n## Date formatting\n\n-   we'll take a number, and apply special formatting to it to make it look like a date\n    -   so `45483` will become `10/07/2024`\n-   Excel dates are stored as the number of days since Jan 1st 1900\n-   you can prove this to yourself by typing `1` into a cell, then formatting it as a date using the number formatting menu: </br>![Formatting 1 as a date](images/clipboard-4127875250.png){height=\"300\"}\n-   you can also format as a date via the Format Cells dialogue (`Ctrl` + `1`)\n\n## Don't try and cheat with dates!\n\n-   date formatting is one of the commonest pain points in Excel\n- dates are extremely complicated, and we often want to calculate with them\n-   the advice is simple: dates should always be stored as these numbers, and then formatted to look like dates\n    - don't try to cheat by writing dates as text\n    - use formatting to produce your preferred date format in the  Format Cells tools instead </br>![Format Cells](images/clipboard-1573227329.png){height=\"200\"}\n\n## Formatting vs other things\n\n(or, keep your sheets clean)\n\n-   it's common to see Excel sheets that contain lots of extraneous bits\n    -   headers, copyright info, explanations...\n-   ideally, all this extra stuff should be kept well away from your data, as it makes it harder to process that data safely\n-   ...and you should definitely be using tables to help with this\n\n## Conditional formatting\n\n-   this can get complicated, and we'll revisit more fancy conditional formatting in the intermediate training sessions\n-   the big idea is that conditional formatting alters the format as values change\n\n## Progress bars\n-   Put a few random numbers in a column ![Put a few random numbers in a column](images/clipboard-1315843620.png){height=\"100\"}\n\n-   Select them, and go to the Conditional Formatting menu ![go to the Conditional Formatting menu](images/clipboard-867757489.png){height=\"50\"}\n\n-   Select Data Bars </br>![Select Data Bars](images/clipboard-83873237.png){height=\"300\"}\n\n## Duplicate values\n-   Now clear that conditional formatting </br>![Clear conditional formatting](images/clipboard-199897657.png){height=\"300\"}\n-   Add a duplicate value to your numbers </br> ![Add a duplicate value to your numbers](images/clipboard-3663616570.png){height=\"150\"}\n\n## Duplicate values\n-   Highlight duplicate values </br>![Highlight duplicate values](images/clipboard-3254436237.png)\n\n## Red-Amber-Green reporting\n-   RAG reporting with icon sets </br>![RAG reporting with icon sets](images/clipboard-2465658889.png)\n\n## Key shortcuts\n\n-   `Ctrl` + `1` for the Format Cells dialogue\n-   `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F` to clear formats\n-   `Ctrl` + `v`, `Ctrl`, `v` to paste values only\n\n## Formatting tips\n\n-   Accessibility is much more important than beauty\n-   Use number formatting for dates, currency, percentages\n-   Consider using validation to make sure that cells only contain what you expect them to contain\n-   Consider locking cells to protect formatting when that formatting is really important\n-   Use conditional formatting sparingly\n",
