Lots of useful information & tips.\n- found the session interesting, there is always something that you can learn from these sessions\n- Great, I learned a lot in one hour.\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Welcome\n\n-   this session is for ðŸŒ¶ Excel beginners\n-   this is a mainly-practical session, and you'll need Excel of some sort to follow along\n\n\n## Where does this fit in?\n\n![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-3911010684.png)\n\n-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files, and a little bit of A1 referencing)\n-   we're going to dodge formatting and formulas as much as possible today\n\n## Session outline\n\n- a word of warning\n- understanding tidy data\n- a practical introduction to making tidy data\n- text to columns\n- transposing\n\n## A word of warning\n\n-   tidying data can be very slow and complicated\n-   in Excel, there are lots of advanced tools that can speed things up\n-   this is a beginner's session, so we'll avoid the more fancy tools\n-   **but** if your process takes lots of manual work, it's definitely worth exploring alternative ways of working\n\n## Tidy data \n\n\n\n\n|date       | service_a| service_b|\n|:----------|---------:|---------:|\n|2025-01-01 |        99|        11|\n|2025-01-02 |        77|        33|\n|2025-01-03 |        55|        55|\n\n\n\n. . .\n\n* one value per cell\n* each column contains all the values of one measurement\n* each row shows all the values for one date\n\n## Entering values\n\n-   imagine that we want to measure something across several years: `2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022`?\n-   practical:\n    -   open Excel\n    -   start a new workbook\n    -   add a column header `year` in cell `A1`\n    -   then add each of those five values in the five cells underneath (down to `A6`)\n\n## More values\n\n-   we're going to be using some [birthrate data from the NRS](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/births-time-series-data/) for this session. We'll start by adding some birth rate data\n\n-   this is given as births per 1,000 women in five year age brackets. We'll start with 25-29 year old mothers\n\n-   please add the header `25-29yrs` in cell `B1`\n\n-   here are the values for our five years: `73.4, 71, 66.8, 69.6, 66.7`\n\n## Another column\n\n| 30-34yrs |\n|----------|\n| 90.9     |\n| 88.6     |\n| 83.4     |\n| 85.9     |\n| 84.4     |\n\n-   please could you add some new data to your table showing births for another age group\n\n## Back to tidy data\n\n-   we've now got some data with:\n    -   each value in a cell\n    -   each variable in a column\n        -   here, this is a maternal age bracket\n    -   each observation in a row\n        -   here, this is a year\n\n\n## Fixing several values per cell\n\n-   We often find useful data with more than one value per cell\n-   this can be helpful for humans </br> ![multiple values is good for humans, but bad for Excel](images/clipboard-1363924537.png)\n-   Excel can't do anything with this data\n\n## Exercise: many values per cell\n\n| 35-39\t    |\n|-----------|\n| 54.2 (21%)|\n| 52.7 (20%)|\n| 49.4 (19%)|\n| 52.8 (20%)|\n| 52\t(20%) |\n\n- please add this column of data to your table\n- does it look similar to your existing data?\n\n\n## What's the solution?\n\n-   make this data have **one value per cell**\n-   we could remove all the percentages by hand\n-   `Text to Columns` gives us a better tool for the job </br> ![Text to Columns gives us a better tool for the job](images/clipboard-3594403318.png)\n\n## Text to Columns\n\n-   select a column\n-   in the `Data` tab of the ribbon, you should find the `Text to Columns` tool </br> ![Text to Columns tool](images/clipboard-3002655192.png)\n-   note that you can keep, or remove, the percentage column. We'll **skip** it, to keep things simple </br> ![keep, or remove, the percentage column](images/clipboard-4061284093.png)\n\n\n## Exercise: transposed data\n\n| Bracket | 2018| 2019| 2020| 2021| 2022|\n|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 25-29yrs|73.4 |71.0\t|66.8\t|69.6\t|66.7 |\n| 30-34yrs|90.9\t|88.6\t|83.4\t|85.9\t|84.4 |\n| 35-39yrs|54.2\t|52.7\t|49.4\t|52.8\t|52.0 |\n\n-   sometimes you'll find data where the columns and rows have been flipped \n-   that's slow to fix by hand, but luckily you can **transpose it**, which swaps rows and columns\n-   select your data, and copy/paste into a new cell\n-   then use the transpose option <br>![transpose option](images/clipboard-3580893754.png)\n\n",
