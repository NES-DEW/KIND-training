That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:\n\n+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd) (this session)\n+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd)\n+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)\n+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd)\n+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)\n+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)\t\t\n\nTogether, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers a general overview of our beginner's skill tree:\n\n![KIND Excel beginner's skill tree](images/clipboard-3454618035.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n  \n## Previous attendees have said...  \n  \n- 109 previous attendees have left feedback\n- 99% would recommend this session to a colleague\n- 95% said that this session was pitched correctly  \n\n  \n![](excel_first_steps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){fig-align='left' width=288}  \n  \n:::{.callout-note}  \n### Three random comments from previous attendees  \n- Session was very informative and useful, it will be great to build up excel skills over the next few weeks\n- Very informative with simple easy steps to follow.\n- Engaging and informative!\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n\n## A brief overview of Excel\n\n![Excel might be the cement of the universe](images/clipboard-965547330.png){width=\"60%\"}\n\n-   one of the oldest, and most widely used, pieces of desktop software\n-   ubiquitous in business, finance, health and social care...\n-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for\n-   many versions\n\n## But Excel is badly used, on the whole\n\n+ [PHE lost 16k COVID19+ results](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england)\n+ [MI5 bugged 134 people they didn't mean to](https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/jul/01/mi5-data-collection-errors)\n+ [JP Morgan 2012](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2013/02/19/solutions-to-spreadsheet-risk-post-jpms-london-whale/) had a manually-updated spreadsheet\n  - divided by sum, rather than average\n  - massive losses, $2 - $6 billion??\n\n## And most of us fall into Excel work...\n\n+ most of us haven't had any data training\n  + e.g. in KIND network (which is a very techy group) 75% didn't have a formal qualification\n+ and the responsibility for doing that data work well falls on many of us\n  + data work has become more prominent in lots of jobs\n+ but good data work is really important...\n\n## Good data helps...\n\n-   answering which/when questions\n-   seeing effects of changes\n-   comparing different areas\n-   looking at services over time\n-   ...\n\n## One word of warning before the practical part\n\n-   there are lots of versions of Excel\n-   they all work slightly differently\n-   please don't panic if what you see looks slightly different from what I'm showing you\n-   please ask if you're not happy/confident!\n\n## Opening Excel (desktop)\n\n+ find Excel in your Windows Start menu </br>![opening Excel on the Desktop](images/clipboard-1394052793.png)\n+ you'll need to create a new blank workbook </br>\n![Create a new blank workbook](images/clipboard-2150015829.png){height=\"200\"}\n\n## Opening Excel (web)\n\n+ usually at [https://www.office.com/launch/excel](https://www.office.com/launch/excel)\n+ you'll need to create a new blank workbook </br>\n![Create a new blank workbook](images/clipboard-3067626588.png)\n\n## Interface\n\n![Excel interface](images/interface.png){width=\"90%\"}\n\n## Central idea\n\n-   pieces of data are stored in cells\n    -   one value, one cell\n-   cells are arranged into rows and columns</br> ![cells are arranged in rows and columns](images/clipboard-1879510795.png){width=\"60%\"}\n-   arranging data like this allows us to analyse it\n  - it's not just *Word on a grid*\n  \n## Save, close, open\n\n![File menu](images/clipboard-3187630465.png){height=\"40%\"} ![Save as](images/clipboard-1979369937.png){height=\"40%\"}\n\n-   save your new workbook\n-   close it\n-   re-open it (possibly from recent files)\n\n## References\n\n-   every cell in Excel has a **reference** - like its address\n-   references look like this: `E7` <br> ![example references](images/cols.png){height=\"250\"}\n    -   `E` refers to a vertical column\n    -   `7` to a horizontal row\n\n## Data entry\n\n-   let's add some data...\n-   we can type into the cells </br> ![add data by typing into cells](images/clipboard-1771455666.png)\n-   that data appears in the formula bar too\n\n## An example: school holidays\n\n-   Here are some [school holiday dates](https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2)\n-   make three headings in row 1: `name`, `start_date`, `end_date` </br> ![add three headings in row 1](images/clipboard-1395187747.png)\n\n## Values\n\n-   let's add some values from the [school holiday dates](https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2)\n-   name of holiday\n-   start date\n-   end date\n    -   dates usually go `DD/MM/YYYY` \n    - as we'll see, Excel does lots of helping when we enter dates...\n    -   ...ðŸ˜±\n-   we'll only need a few rows of data\n\n::: notes\nname start_date end_date Mid-term holidays 14/10/2024 18/10/2024 In service day 21/10/2024 21/10/2024 St Andrew's Day 02/12/2024 02/12/2024\n:::\n\n## Tidy data\n\n-   keep things consistent - spelling, case, formats, etc\n    -   one piece of data per cell\n    -   one instance per row (one school holiday per row)\n    -   one variable per column (a column of names, one of start dates...)\n\n## Tables\n\n-   we can convert this group of cells into a proper **table**\n-   click in one of your cells of data </br> ![Click a cell in your data](images/clipboard-1117112977.png)\n-   `Insert` \\> `Table` (or `Ctrl` + `T`) </br> ![Convert to table](images/clipboard-166790706.png)\n-   click `OK`</br>![](images/clipboard-77557231.png)\n\n## Lots of new things to see\n\n![Table features](images/clipboard-1614882971.png)\n\n## Autofill\n\n-   we'll add a formula to calculate how long our holidays are\n-   add a new column called `days`\n-   paste `= 1 + (C2 - B2)` into the first cell of that new column\n    -   and look out for our session on formulas...\n-   double-click the green fill handle to fill the rest of the column </br> ![fill handle](images/clipboard-1731283483.png)\n\n## Formatting\n\n-   we can change the way that our spreadsheet looks\n-   we can also change the way our values look\n\n## Cell formatting\n\n-   some examples </br> ![Formatting area](images/clipboard-4175540765.png)\n    -   highlighting\n    -   bold\n    -   borders\n\n## Number formatting\n\n-   our dates are **number formatted**\n-   Excel dates are actually numbers (like `45583`) formatted to look like dates\n-   1900 dates!\n-   percentages, Â£, ...\n\n## Conditional formatting\n\n-   we can also format based on values </br> ![Conditional formatting](images/clipboard-3358194074.png)\n-   take care though - this can be both ugly, and inaccessible\n",
