Thanks Brendan\n- Really useful for going over basic concepts that I haven't studied in a long time. So it was great for relearning the basic building blocks of how Excel works. Appropriate level for beginners session.\n  \n:::  \n:::\n\n\n\n-   this session is 🌶 - aimed at Excel beginners\n-   you'll need any version of Excel to follow along\n-   you can find session materials at **tinyurl.com/kindtrp**\n\n\n\n\n## Where does this fit in?\n\n![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-1882650124.png)\n\n-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files)\n-   you'll also need to be familiar with A1 referencing, values, and tables\n-   we're going to avoid talking about formatting as much as possible today\n\n## Session outline\n\n-   values and formulas\n-   simple functions\n-   references in formulas\n\n## Values and formulas\n\n-   cells in Excel contain either values, or formulas\n-   we'll start with some data derived from [NRS 2022 population estimates](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-22/mid-year-pop-est-22-data.xlsx)\n-   make sure [you have the sample data](src/excel_formulas.xlsx) available\n\n## Values\n\n![Example value, showing identical cell contents and formula bar contents](images/clipboard-3551345224.png)\n\n-   when you enter some data in a cell, we call that a **value**\n-   values look the same in their cell as in the formula bar\n\n## Formulas\n\n-   we can also make a value using a formula\n-   Excel evaluates/calculates the formula, then displays the result as a value\n-   in an empty cell, try entering `= 2 + 2`\n\n\n![Example formula, showing different cell contents and formula bar contents](images/clipboard-3551345224b.png)\n\n## Example formulas\n\n-   we can do ordinary arithmetic in formulas `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`...\n-   you can also try `&` which joins values\n    -   `= \"This number is \" & 5`\n\n## Functions\n\n-   But most formulas use functions, which are like the verbs of Excel\n-   Try `= SUM(2, 2)`\n\n## Adding functions\n\n-   you can type functions in by name (as above)\n\n-   you can also add from the `Formulas` area of the ribbon </br>![add from the Formulas area of the ribbon](images/clipboard-4177249094.png)\n\n-   or you can use the $fx$ button by the formula bar </br>![use the fx button by the formula bar](images/clipboard-2091819162.png)\n\n## Function arguments\n\n-   adding a function by $fx$ or the menu brings up the **Function Arguments** interface </br>![Function Arguments interface](images/clipboard-2410234964.png)\n\n-   This is a helpful builder for more complicated functions\n\n## What are arguments?\n\n+   **arguments** are the values we supply to a function \n    \n    + in `=SUM(2,3)`, the arguments are `2` and `3`\n+   we separate arguments with a comma `,`\n+   we need to be sure we're supplying the right arguments in the right order (this gets described as the **syntax** of a function)\n+   we also, while we're on the jargon, say that functions **return** a value so `= SUM(4,3)` will return `7`\n\n## Useful simple functions\n\n-   in the same way as `=SUM()`, you can try:\n    -   `AVERAGE`\n    -   `MIN` and `MAX`\n    -   `SUBSTITUTE`\n    -   `CEILING`\n    -   `TODAY`\n    -   `ROUND`\n\n## References in formulas\n\n-   mostly, you won't add values directly into your formulas\n-   instead, you'll bring them in from another part of your spreadsheet\n-   can you use `SUM()` to make a total `Male` + `Female` column in the supplied data?\n    -   add a header in cell `G2`\n    -   if needed, extend the table to include your new column\n    -   in `G3`, enter the formula `= SUM(C3, D3)`\n    -   then copy down the rows by double-clicking the green fill handle ![green fill handle](images/clipboard-4213326820.png)\n\n## Practice\n\n-   calculate what proportion of your total population is under 16 (thanks, Lara Paterson (NHS Lanarkshire))\n- estimate the population density\n- find an average area for each council area\n\n## Troubleshooting functions\n\n-   `#NAME?` = \"I don't recognise that function name\"\n-   `#VALUE!` = \"Your syntax has gone wrong - usually in the wrong order\"\n-   `#REF!` = \"I don't recognise that reference\"\n-   `#DIV/0!` = \"You've divided by zero\"\n\n\n",
