## Session outline

-   In this session, we're going to build part of the GP practice size dashboard from last time
-   But we'll do this from raw data, rather than the play data we used last time
-   We'll bring that data in directly from the web
-   We'll need to wrangle that data to get it to behave

## A word of warning

-   data wrangling is one area where the web version of Power BI is **much less capable** than the desktop version
-   that means that we're going to use Excel/PowerQuery to do most of the heavy lifing for us here
-   if the desktop version of Power BI is any guide, I'd hope that these tools will eventually be integrated into the web version of Power BI before too long

## Data wrangling

-   several different sources needed
    -   some real [open data about GP practices ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/f23655c3-6e23-4103-a511-a80d998adb90/resource/a160fa97-8a3c-429a-9683-3835cafe1701/download/practice_contactdetails_jul2023-open-data.csv)
    -   [Health board names ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/datastore/dump/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc?bom=True)
    -   [Demographic data for GP practices ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/datastore/dump/d7f423dd-9611-4ae9-a9c8-4dcc532ece22?bom=True)

## Load our data

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Open Excel and create a blank workbook</br>![create a blank workbook](../src/images/clipboard-3287158368.png){height="200"}
2.  In the `Data` tab of the ribbon menu, select the `From Web` option </br> ![select the `From Web` option](../src/images/clipboard-563180817.png){height="100"}
3.  Supply the first URL </br>![Supply the first URL](../src/images/clipboard-1386370273.png){height="100"}
4.  Select `Load` </br>![](../src/images/clipboard-1784687147.png){height="200"}
5.  Repeat with the remaining URLs
6.  Save your workbook
:::

## Inspect our data

-   You should be able to see each of your datasets in Excel as separate worksheets (with pretty horrible names) ![new worksheets in Excel](../src/images/clipboard-1507354050.png)

## PowerQuery

Next, we'll open these three sets of data in PowerQuery by selecting `Launch Power Query Editor...` from the `Get Data` menu:</br> ![Launch Power Query Editor...](../src/images/clipboard-468826289.png){height="300"}

## Navigating PowerQuery

![PowerQuery interface](../src/images/clipboard-3570519607.png)

-   on the left, you'll see three queries, corresponding to the three datasets you loaded from the web
-   in the centre of the page, you'll see an Excel-like preview of your data
-   above the data, you'll see an Excel-like ribbon menu and formula area
-   on the right, you'll see the details of your query

## Renaming our data

-   To make life easier, we'll rename each query by right-clicking the query title on the left-hand side of the screen </br>![rename each query](../src/images/clipboard-4147252052.png):
    -   call the GP practice details `practices`
    -   call the NHS boards data `practices`
    -   call the demographic data `demographics`

## Task list

-   we can discard some of the **practices** data
-   we'll need to join **boards** and **practices** to get nice health board names in our dashboard
-   we'll need to re-shape **demographics**
-   and we'll need to send our wrangled data to Power BI

## First steps in PowerQuery

-   find your `boards` data
-   (reminder about the [duty of data minimization](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-protection-principles/a-guide-to-the-data-protection-principles/the-principles/data-minimisation/))
-   we can safely lose several columns:
    -   `_id`, `HBDateEnacted`, `HBDateArchived` and `Country` are all spare
    -   right click the column header to `Remove` </br>![remove columns](../src/images/clipboard-1367785018.png)

## The big idea

-   once you've removed a column, you'll see a change to the `Applied Steps` area: </br> ![Applied steps are](../src/images/clipboard-1786703847.png)
-   we've gained an extra step, showing that we've removed a column

## Steps
-   if you click an earlier step, you can see the state of your data at that point
-   if you click the `X` to the left of the step, you can delete (effectively undo) that step
-   if you click the gearwheel to the right of the step name, you can alter the way that step worked
    -   if you're code-confident, you can also tweak the PowerQuery M formula that appears in the formula bar

## PowerQuery -> Excel

-   Once you've removed the unnecessary columns, click `Close & Load` to commit your changes </br>![Commit your changes](../src/images/clipboard-3018844657.png)
- that will return your data to Excel

## Excel -> Power BI
- from Excel, rename your tables
    -   call the GP practice details `practices`
    -   call the NHS boards data `practices`
    -   call the demographic data `demographics`
-   ensure the .xlsx is saved
-   connect to Power BI as before

## Service vs Desktop
+ we'll need to do this slighly ungainly Excel -> PowerQuery -> Excel -> PowerBI route whenever we tweak our data
+ on the desktop, PowerQuery is integrated into Power BI, which makes things much smoother
+ this might be a good point to explore setting up a connection between your OneDrive and Power BI service as it'll reduce the messiness of re-re-uploading data as you tweak it

## Joining data

-   there's an **HB** column in both the **boards** and **practices** data
-   we can link these up so that we can use the actual proper health board names in our dashboard

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  select the HB column and select **Merge Queries** </br> ![select Merge Queries](../src/images/merge.png)
1.  fill in the options in the merge pop-up </br> ![merge pop-up](../src/images/merge2.png){height="300px"}
2.  note that this gives us lots of information about how the join is likely to work
:::

-   a slight puzzle: the join initially looks pretty unpromising </br>![nested columns](../src/images/merge3.png)
-   here, Power Query is effectively telling you that there are several columns packed into this new column
-   we can unpack all or some of the columns from each row using the menu in the column header.
-   I think we only want **HBName** - but feel free to experiment as you can always backtrack from the query settings pane

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  select the column(s) you want to keep from the column header </br> ![Select your columns from the expand button](../src/images/merge4.png){height="150px"}
:::

-   you can also access lots of other Excel-ish options by right-clicking the column
-   something we can do there is to rename this column to give a nicer name (which we'll need to use later while building our visualisation)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  please rename your new column to **"HBName"**
2.  note that you can also do this inside the formula bar at the top of the screen </br> ![Formula bar](../src/images/merge5.png)</br> This formula is written in **Power Query M**, which we'll discuss later
3.  check that you now have nice board names in the practices data
4.  remember to **close & apply**
:::

## Re-shaping data

-   our demographics data is going to be hard to plot
  - Power BI generally expects data with one variable per column
  - in this data, our useful variables (like the count of patients in particular age or sex brackets) are spread across several columns
-   we'll reshape it using Power Query to make our life easier

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  As before, please **Transform Data**
2.  Use the **Select columns** tool (or delete as before) to remove the **id**, **Date**, **HSPC**, **HB**, and **SexQF** columns
3.  You can do this in Power Query directly with `= Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"_id", "Date", "HB", "HSCP", "SexQF"})`
1.  Select the **PracticeCode** and **Sex** columns, then select **Unpivot Other Columns**</br>![Unpivot Other Columns](../src/images/pivot_1.png){height="350px"}
:::

-   That should give us our data in long form, so that it looks like this: </br> ![long form data](../src/images/pivot_2.png)
- this will make it easier to plot in Power BI as we usually need to have one variable (like number of patients in an age/sex bracket) in a single column
-   we can now remove unwanted values by filtering </br>![remove unwanted values by filtering](../src/images/pivot_3.png){height="300px"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  From the **Attribute** column, please remove the **QF** rows,
2.  From the **Attribute** column, please remove the **AllAges** rows
3.  From the **Sex** column, please remove the **All** rows
:::

## Transforming values

-   the last type of reshaping to show off is about transforming values

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Split the **Attribute** column by **Digit to Non-digit**</br>![Digit to non-digit](../src/images/pivot_4.png){height="150px"}
2.  replace values in the new **Attribute.1** column to remove the "Ages"
3.  then in **Attribute.2**, two replacements to remove the "to"s and replace the "plus" with **99**
4.  then rename the columns to **age_upper** and **age_lower**
5.  finally, change the data type to **whole number** for each of those new columns
:::

## Tidying up

-   we should now be able to use this data to re-make our GP bubble map from last time.
-   there are some minor bits of tidying up that need to happen first
-   there are a few duplicate practice names, which might cause us problems </br>![Duplicate practice names](../src/images/barclay.png)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  select **Transform data**
2.  add a **Custom column** called Practice Name</br> ![Add a custom column](../src/images/cust_col.png){height="200px"}
3.  use `&` to concatenate values: `[GPPracticeName] & " (" & [Postcode] & ")"`
4.  close and apply
:::

-   Power BI likes to summarize data wherever possible
-   this can cause problems (although I don't think there's anything in this example that suffers from it)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Go to the data view
2.  In the **practices** table, note that you can change the summary options for the **PracticeListSize** column </br>![Summary defaults](../src/images/summ_list.png){height="200px"}
:::

## Re-making our visualisation

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Add a map, and set the **Postcode** to Location, **boards.HBName** to Legend, **PracticeListSize** to Bubble Size
2.  Format the map to greyscale
3.  Rename for this visual to suit
1.  add a slicer for Health board
2.  add cards for the list size and practice name
3.  add a stacked column chart for practice sizes
:::

## Finishing up

-   next time, we'll use some of that data we wrangled today to extend our GP dashboard
-   **please save your files from today somewhere safe**
-   if you have time during the week, come back to the visualizations that we sketched today, and play. What would you like to add to the dashboard?
    -   there's a lot of demographic data to play with
-   Let me know, and we'll try adding those things next time
