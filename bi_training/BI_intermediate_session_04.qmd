This is part of our intermediate-level Power BI desktop course. The course structure is as follows:

-   session 1 (this session): [a simple build-a-dashboard session as a warmup, reminder about core Power BI techniques, and sharing some suggestions for good workflow practices](BI_intermediate_session_01.qmd)
-   session 2: [DAX language foundations, including FILTER and CALCULATE](BI_intermediate_session_02.qmd)
-   session 3: [core PowerQuery functions](BI_intermediate_session_03.qmd) to manage sources, join data sets, pivot, and tidy values
-   session 4 (this session): [PowerQuery M language foundations](BI_intermediate_session_04.qmd), including a basic overview of syntax, a core function toolkit, advanced mode, and reproducibility
-   session 5: a second, more ambitious, build-a-dashboard session to put all that PowerQuery and DAX knowledge into practice

## Session outline

-   what's PQM?
- setting values and creating lists
-   the Advanced Editor
-   basic syntax: `let`/`in`
-   defining and using functions

## What's PQM?

-   formula language used in Power Query
-   similar to Excel formulas

## Getting started

-   open Power BI
-   create a blank report
-   then click `Tranform data` to open PQ
-   add a blank query </br>![Blank query](../src/images/clipboard-243002182.png)

## Add a value to that query

-   you can edit PQM in the formula bar
-   let's start with the traditional expression: `Hello world!`
    -   you don't need quotes
-   call this a [primitive value](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/expressions-values-and-let-expression#primitive-value)



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   add `"Hello world"` to the formula bar </br>![Hello world](../src/images/clipboard-1199358198.png)
:::

## Lists

-   an especially-useful kind of value: the **list**



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
- make a new blank query
- in the formula bar, after the equals-sign, type a `{`, then some comma-separated numbers, then a closing `}` </br> ![List syntax](../src/images/clipboard-779827820.png)
:::

## Functions

-   PQM has 700+ functions
-   some can be used directly on values



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   update your hello world to `= Text.Lower("Hello world")` in the formula bar
:::

## Warning

-   PQM is case-sensitive, unlike basically all the other Microsoft formula languages: ![PQM is case-sensitive](../src/images/clipboard-376022155.png)

## Query steps

-   you can add query steps using the Add Step ($fx$) button: </br>![Add Step](../src/images/clipboard-932557527.png)



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   Add a step, and insert the formula `= Text.Proper(Source)` </br> ![Capitalised output](../src/images/clipboard-3853673537.png)
:::



-   `Source` in the formula is the name of your first step
-   That should create a new step named `Custom1`

## Advanced editor

-   you can do more interesting work in PQM using the Advanced Editor </br> ![Advanced Editor](../src/images/clipboard-3778934641.png)



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   please open the `Advanced Editor` now </br>![Advanced Editor view](../src/images/clipboard-1473577876.png)
:::

## Advanced editor

-   the advanced editor should contain your two query steps:



```         
let
    Source = Text.Lower("Hello world!"),
    Custom1 = Text.Proper(Source)
in
    Custom1
```

## `let`/`in`

-   let statements are the basic structural building-block of PQM
-   the `let` part contains a series of steps
-   the `in` part returns the result of those steps

## `let`

-   each line of the `let` has a step name, and an expression:
    -   `name = expression`
-   each expression (apart from the source) refers to a previous step
-   in our example, we make a step named `Source`, which contains our lowercase `"hello world"`
-   we then pass it to a second step named `Custom1` where we transform it into Proper Case



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   rename the second step to `proper_case`
:::

## `in`

-   the `in` section is where we return a result from our query
-   you'll need to match the name in `in` to the correct stage of your query - almost always the last value



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   update line 5 (after the `in`) to use your new name for `Custom1`
-   then select `Done` to return to Power Query - you should see your new step name in the `Applied Steps` menu</br> ![Applied Steps menu](../src/images/clipboard-3154301732.png)
:::

## Query steps

-   we can use the Advanced Editor to change the sequence of query steps



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   open the advanced editor

-   break down your source step into two steps:

    1.  a `Source` step, where we input the "Hello world" primitive value
    2.  a `lower_case` step, where we use the `Text.Lower` function on `Source`

-   make sure your lines end with `,` (except the final line of `let` and `in`)

-   make sure your names link up correctly, and then apply the changes.
- you should see the change in your `Applied Steps` pane
:::

## Query steps

-   your query should now read: </br>![Advanced editor view](../src/images/clipboard-1882963271.png)\
-   those names should be reflected in the query steps view: </br>![Applied steps with new step names](../src/images/clipboard-4012119365.png)\

## Nested let

-   we could re-arrange our expression to use nested `let`s
-   this is helpful when things grow more complex



```         
let 
    lower_case = 
        let 
            Source = "Hello world!"
        in 
            Text.Lower(Source), 
            proper_case = Text.Proper(lower_case)
in 
    proper_case
```

## Defining functions

-   we can define functions of our own
-   let's make one now that prints "Hello world!" for us



::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   make a new blank query and open it in the advanced editor populate with the code below
:::



```         
let
    hw = () => "Hello world!"
in
    hw
```
+ `hw` here is an ordinary step name
+ `()` will contain our parameters
+ `=>` defines this as containing a function

## Naming functions

- that creates a new function
- note that the function name will correspond with our query name (it's not the step name): </br>![Function named query 2](../src/images/clipboard-820927735.png)
-   we could use that function as-is: </br>![Default query naming](../src/images/clipboard-1548123534.png)
-   but properly-named functions are much more useful: do that by renaming the query as a whole to `hw`

## Using functions

-   functions defined in this way are global: we can use them in any other query
    - so `hw()` will work in Query1 to generate our `Hello world!` text: `Source = hw()`
    -   the order of queries (Query1, Query2, etc) doesn't affect function definitions and use
-   but within a query, you'll need to define a function before you can use it

## Defining functions within queries

```         
let 
    hw2 = () => "Hello world!",
    Source = hw2(),
    lower_case = Text.Lower(Source),
    proper_case = Text.Proper(lower_case)
in 
    proper_case
```



-   `hw2()` has local scope: you can't use it in other queries

## Add a parameter

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
-   make a new blank query and name it `lower_proper`
-   in the formula bar, define the function `= (x) => Text.Proper(Text.Lower(x))`
-   check the parameter option that should appear below the formula bar: </br> ![Parameter options](../src/images/clipboard-2873238028.png)
:::

## Re-edit your original query

-   to use `lower_proper` instead of `Text.Lower` etc

```         
let
    Source = hw(),
    proper_case = lower_proper(Source)
in 
    proper_case
```

## Bonus: types

-   you can [specify types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/m-spec-types) in your function:

`= (x as text) as text => Text.Proper(Text.Lower(x))`
