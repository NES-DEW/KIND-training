## Introduction

-   this session is 🌶 - for beginners
- it's designed as a demonstration session to show what Power Automate might be used to achieve, and how it works
- it's **not** designed as a practical follow-along session
    - you (probably) won't have time to replicate all the steps here yourself during the session
    - we have practical training sessions available to cover all this material and more

## Session outline

-   a warning
-   an introduction
-   scope of the possible
-   three example tasks
-   free play

## A word of warning

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Warning

Do not use Power Automate for anything unless you're absolutely sure that your organisational policies permit it
:::

-   many boards and orgs have serious information governance and information security objections to Power Automate
    -   automation tools are an excellent way to break your data
    -   they're also an excellent way to compromise its integrity/security
    -   especially true if you're thinking about automating processes with sensitive information
    -   if in any doubt, speak to your IG/Caldicott/information security colleagues before setting to work

## Quick introduction to Power Automate

-   [Power Automate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Power_Automate) is a set of low-code automation tools
-   allows users to automate tasks
-   lots of options
    -   [web](https:://www.powerautomate.com) and [desktop versions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/desktop-flows/install)
    -   several [different subscription levels](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-automate/#Pricing)
    -   hundreds of add-ons

## Scope of the possible

-   Power Automate is an extremely useful tool for H&SC
-   but you should be aware of some complicating factors for people like us:
    -   [massive and confusing](https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/Default-10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a/templates) range of different templates and use-cases, often with a business-focus
    -   a thick layer of promotional AI talk over everything at present (late 2024)
    -   unexpected cost/IG barriers to using parts of the platform
    -   glitchy, and often requiring more coding skills than you might expect
    -   [generally shockingly poor documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/)

## This session = honest, application-focused, introduction

-   we'll build three example flows that will:
    1.  take an Excel workbook, extract some parts of it, and save as a new Excel file
    2.  turn a response to Microsoft Forms into a Teams post
    3.  turn an Excel workbook into a simple mailing list

## Subset an Excel file

-   you'll need a sample data file - I used [this open data about council assets from Falkirk](https://opendata.scot/datasets/falkirk+council-council+asset+register+-+falkirk/)
-   in Excel, I converted the data to a table, then saved the workbook to OneDrive
-   in [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com), then create a new flow via `New flow > Instant cloud flow`  \n![Instant cloud flow](../src/images/clipboard-1863368884.png)
-   then `Manually trigger a flow`  \n![Manually trigger a flow](../src/images/clipboard-2098982554.png)
-   Add a step   \n![Add a step](../src/images/clipboard-186036160.png)
-   `Excel online > List rows present in a table` and populate  \n ![List rows present in a table](../src/images/clipboard-523258398.png)
-   there are several ways we could subset the data  \n ![subset the data](../src/images/clipboard-909526396.png)
-   we'll demonstrate by taking the first 20 rows  \n ![take the first 20 rows](../src/images/clipboard-3113671612.png)
-   `Create csv table`   \n ![Create csv table](../src/images/clipboard-1492307871.png)
-   `Create file`   \n![Create file](../src/images/clipboard-3364586860.png)\

## Microsoft Forms to Teams

-   here's an overview  \n![Overview (floverview?) of a Form-to-Teams flow](../src/images/clipboard-3171169259.png)
-   create a simple form (ours is at <https://forms.office.com/e/8Zds2aTS5c>)  \n![create a simple form](../src/images/clipboard-2678316851.png)
-   grab the form id   \n![grab the form id](../src/images/clipboard-3599278669.png)
-   create an `Build an automated cloud flow` -   \n![Build an automated cloud flow](../src/images/clipboard-3500499466.png)
-   Enter your form ID   \n![Enter your form ID](../src/images/clipboard-977889460.png)(veDvEDCgykuAnLXmdF5Jmn79kl25VpJIq3eErXXCYKBUMU9LWURaUUhUT0xYOUtNQVY1UFpURTQ1Vi4u)
-   `Get response details`   \n![Get response details](../src/images/clipboard-1023983558.png)
-   Populate with the form and step details   \n![Populate with the form and step details](../src/images/clipboard-3695518768.png)
-   `Post message in a chat or channel`   \n![Post message in a chat or channel](../src/images/clipboard-3431396843.png)

## Excel workbook to mailing list

-   here's an overview   \n![overview](../src/images/clipboard-985184515.png)
-   start with a simple .xlsx. Again, that will need to be on Sharepoint or Onedrive   \n![start with a simple .xlsx](../src/images/clipboard-719218061.png)
-   `List rows present in a table`   \n![Add a List rows present in a table](../src/images/clipboard-2050216422.png)
-   `Apply to each`   \n![Apply to each](../src/images/clipboard-1086607329.png)
-   `Send an email notification (V3)` nested inside the `Apply to each`  \n![Nest your email notification inside an apply to each](../src/images/clipboard-708934752.png)
-   add the expression `items('For_each')?['email']` ![add the expression `items('For_each')?['email']`](../src/images/clipboard-4251490288.png)
-   enjoy the result  \n![Many emails result](../src/images/clipboard-1453222920.png)
