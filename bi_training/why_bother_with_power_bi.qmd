## Welcome

-   welcome to **Why bother with Power BI?**
-   this session is 🥬 - a non-technical introduction for pre-beginners


## Forthcoming sessions
```{r}
KINDR::training_sessions(tr_type = "Power BI", start_date = params[["sl_date"]], n = 5, hide_area = T)
```

## Session outline

- an overview of Power BI
- quick production demo
- five ways that Power BI might help
- so what's the catch?
- next steps and training

## A brief overview of Power BI

-   new-ish, c.2015
-   integrates several existing Microsoft products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQuery, various SQL reporting tools)
-   produces interactive dashboards
-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for

## Central idea

-   data is complicated
-   good data analysis helps make services better
-   but predicting what data users will need is hard

## Why are users so fussy about their data?

-   data can be used to answer lots of different kinds of questions
    -   answering which/when questions
    -   seeing effects of changes
    -   comparing different areas
    -   looking at services over time
    -   ...




## Power BI demo

## take [a spreadsheet](data/gp_pract.xlsx) and load that data </br>

# Five ways that Power BI might help you

## 1: making data fun makes data useful

+ from [this](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes/resource/47557411-7eda-4278-9d6d-d26ed2ceab5a) to [this](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/142a9fa6-131d-4244-91aa-d2742626abc4/e2e8afcda6810eb12b80?experience=power-bi)
+ a great way of making more out of the data you already hold

## 2: you need a data hub

+ Provides a standard way of accessing data from lots of sources 
+ call this a [data hub](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMDlhZGU4OWQtZTNmMi00MzNhLTllYzQtNmFjZjg5MTI4YTBkIiwidCI6IjM3YzM1NGIyLTg1YjAtNDdmNS1iMjIyLTA3YjQ4ZDc3NGVlMyJ9)
+ great for sharing with a well-defined group
- an excellent way of guarding your spreadsheets
- useful for moving away from holding data on shared drives etc

## 3: the easiest way to build scalable dashboards

+ lower barriers to entry than competitors
+ scales really well ([dashboard example](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODJjOGE3ZDUtM2ViNy00YjBlLTllMjktOTNjZjlkODJhODU4IiwidCI6ImU3YTEzYWVhLTk0MzctNGRiNy1hMjJiLWNmYWE0Y2UzM2I2ZSJ9))
+ scaling isn't free though...

## 4: don't repeat yourself

+ in Excel, when the data changes you need to re-do your work
+ **not so** in Power BI: reproducible data loading pipeline
+ possible route towards real-time data

## 5: let users serve up their own data

+ bored of slicing up spreadsheets and emailing them to people? Let them do it themselves
+ Power BI is a terminal product: it's meant to be used at the end of a data journey
  + don't expect to do much fancy exporting from BI

## Weaknesses

- Power BI needs tidy input data - so use Excel tables, and expect to get good at Power Query etc
- don't believe the no-code lies - you'll need some [DAX](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/) and [Power Query M](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powerquery-m/)
- [publishing is complicated and potentially expensive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/pricing) and requires investigating before building a product
- complex IG picture across Scotland, so please get official guidance early
- a terminal analysis product, so don't plan to take data from Power BI
- struggles with more complex statistical tools - a specific warning here about QI
