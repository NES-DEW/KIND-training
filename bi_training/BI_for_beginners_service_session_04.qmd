## Session materials

Ideally, you'll use the data that you wrangled during the previous session. But if that's not suitable, use this data instead:

-   [{{< iconify ph:file-xls size=2x >}}.xlsx session data](src/s04_data.xlsx)
:::


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

#| fig-height: 0.6
#| fig-width: 3

## Session outline

-   In this session, we're going to build out the GP practice size dashboard from last time
-   we're going to use some new features of Power BI to help us with that
    -   we'll spend a little bit of time looking at the model
    -   but most of the session is about DAX and measures

## Recap

-   we did lots of data wrangling last week using Power Query
-   that's designed to do data loading and tidying - so we tried removing some data, reshaping data, and joining data,...
-   but there's another whole language in Power BI to let us do things with that tidy data: DAX (annoyingly, **Data Analysis eXpressions**)
-   similar to Excel formulas

## Major differences between DAX and Excel formulas

-   Excel takes a cell or range of cells (like A4)
    -   DAX functions take a **column or table** as reference, and cannot use e.g. cell ranges
-   Excel formulas show their results directly in the cell
    -   DAX formulas need to be added to a card (or similar)
-   also a grab-bag of minor differences (no mixed columns data type, date and time functions, different lookup mechanics)

## Set up

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  open your dashboard from the last session
2.  add a new report page, and name it **measures**
3.  remind yourself about the data we're working with
:::

## The model

-   let's start by looking at the model view
-   we should see our data tables as blocks in the model
-   there are also connections between some of those blocks

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Click `Open data model`</br> ![Open the data model](images/clipboard-1311221330.png)
2.  That should open the data model in a new tab </br>   ![data model tab](images/clipboard-1681953392.png)
3. Try expanding the **Properties** pane
:::

## DAX first steps

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  in the model view, click **New measure**
2.  in the formula bar, add `largest_practice = MAX(practices[PracticeListSize])`
:::

## DAX queries

The general way of building a DAX formula is as follows:

> `measure = FUNCTION(table[column])`

-   note the \[square brackets\] for column names
-   we wrote a simple DAX formula in the first session, when we calculated a column using the formula `AvailableBeds = [BedComp] - [ClosedBed]`
-   in this session, we're going to concentrate on using DAX to write **measures**

## WTH are measures?

-   **measures** are Power BI lingo for calculated data summaries
-   calculated columns, as we've seen before, let you make new columns from existing data
-   measures allow you to make non-column summaries of your data - like an average

## DAX queries

For our example, our measure is called **largest_practice**, and we want it to report the largest practice in each health board. Our DAX-based measure works as follows:

-   our data table is called **practices**
-   our column is **PracticeListSize**
-   we're using the `MAX()` function to find the largest value (exactly like Excel)

`largest_practice = MAX(practices[PracticeListSize])`

## Adding our measure to our report

-   we should be able to add our **largest_practice** measure to our report
-   switch back to the report tab
-   you should see the **largest_practice** measure appear in your practices data </br>![largest practices measure](images/measure.png){height="300px"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  add a new card ![new card](images/clipboard-2542732974.png)
2.  in our new measures page, drag the **largest_practice** measure into that card
3.  we also want to be able to look at different boards, so add a slicer ![new slicer](images/clipboard-2985019547.png) using the HBnames from the practices table
:::

## Concatenating

-   so far, our `largest_practice` measure is ugly-but-functional
-   we can use the concatenate operator (`&`) to beautify it

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  edit your `largest_practice` measure (go to the model view and select the measure in the data pane)</br>![edit largest practice](images/clipboard-1457168475.png)
2.  you can insert text by "quoting" it, and using `&` to join it to the result of your `MAX()`
    -   for instance, `largest_practice = "Largest practice: " & max(practices[PracticeListSize]) & " patients"`
3.  go back to the report, and refresh the report ![refresh the report](images/clipboard-1578867801.png)
4.  you can also use the **format visual** section to change the font size, and drop/alter the category label
:::

## Core DAX functions

-   several useful DAX functions work in basically the same way as `MAX()`
-   let's try them out now

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  make a new measure called `average_practice`
2.  try `average_practice = AVERAGE(practices[PracticeListSize])`
3.  add this to a new card to test it
4.  now tweak with concatenated text
5.  `COUNT()`, and `MIN()` should also work in the same way
:::

## Combining functions

-   most measures will need more than one DAX function
-   we combine functions just like Excel, by bracketing them together
-   `function1(function2(data))` does function 2 on the data, then function 1 on that result
-   when you're reading/building formulas with many functions, two top-tips:
    1.  make sure you match your brackets
    2.  read from the inside out

## Beautifying measures

-   our **average_practice** measure is pretty ugly
-   a whole number value would be more suitable

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   click on the **average_practice** measure, which should read `average_practice = AVERAGE(practices[PracticeListSize])`
-   add the `INT()` function, which converts a number to an integer (whole number)
    -   we want `INT()` to wrap around the `AVERAGE()` function
    -   `average_practice = INT(AVERAGE(practices[PracticeListSize]))`
:::

## Combining functions for number formatting

-   we can keep combining functions together in the same way
-   e.g. we could round that result to the nearest hundred using `round(..., -2)`
    -   the `-2` specifies the number of decimal places, so `3` here would give us 3 decimal places (say 444.444).
    -   `average_practice = ROUND(INT(AVERAGE(practices[PracticeListSize])), -2)`
-   care with the brackets!
-   you might prefer to do simple rounding in the **format visual** area </br>![Format visual area](images/card_number_format.png){height="100px"}

## Filter

-   `FILTER()` is the last DAX function we're going to look at
-   it lets us filter our data based on conditions
-   say we want to count how many big practices (more than 10000 patients) we have...
-   `big_practices = countrows(filter(practices, practices[PracticeListSize] > 10000))`
-   let's read this from the inside-out
    -   `filter(practices, practices[PracticeListSize] > 10000)` applies the filter function over the whole **practices** table
    -   it finds all the rows where **PracticeListSize** is greater than (\>) 10000
    -   those rows are then counted by `countrows()`
    -   finally, we save that number into our measure named `big_practices`

## Beautifying our measures

-   that'll be another ugly-but-functional measure
-   we'll use an alternative way of beautifying this one, to avoid making the formula too complicated
-   measures can contain measures
-   instead of the **table\[column\]** format we've been using, we refer to measures by wrapping them in single square-brackets: *\[measure\]*
-   let's create this now

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  add a new measure with the formula `big_practices = countrows(filter(practices, practices[PracticeListSize] > 10000))` to obtain the filtered count of big practices
2.  create a second new measure
3.  `nice_big_practices = [big_practices] & " practices with more than 10000 patients"`
4.  add **nice_big_practices** to a new card
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1.  Please make a new measure named **nice_average_practice**
2.  Use concatenation to make the **average_practice** measure nicer to read
3.  Update your average measure card in the report
:::

## More interesting filters

-   `FILTER()` is one of the big building-blocks of Power BI
-   we can use it as a way of looking up matching data
-   for example, to find the **name** of the largest practice, we can:

```         
largest_practice_name = CALCULATE (
    VALUES (practices[Practice Name]),
    FILTER (
      ALL(practices[PracticeListSize]), 
      practices[PracticeListSize] = MAX (practices[PracticeListSize]
            )
            )
)
```

-   `FILTER()` finds the largest practice
-   `VALUES()` returns the corresponding value from the **Practice Name** column
-   `CALCULATE()` joins the `FILTER()` and `VALUES()` parts of the expression
