This is part of our intermediate-level Power BI desktop course. The course structure is as follows:

-   session 1 (this session): [a simple build-a-dashboard session as a warmup, reminder about core Power BI techniques, and sharing some suggestions for good workflow practices](BI_intermediate_session_01.qmd)
-   session 2: [DAX language foundations, including FILTER and CALCULATE](BI_intermediate_session_02.qmd)
-   session 3: [core PowerQuery functions](BI_intermediate_session_03.qmd) to manage sources, join data sets, pivot, and tidy values
-   session 4 (this session): [PowerQuery M language foundations](BI_intermediate_session_04.qmd), including a basic overview of syntax, a core function toolkit, advanced mode, and reproducibility
-   session 5: a second, more ambitious, build-a-dashboard session to put all that PowerQuery and DAX knowledge into practice

## Session aim

-   we've had four content-heavy training sessions so far
-   session five = about putting your new skills into practice

## Session outline

-   an entirely practical build-a-dashboard session
-   we'll use The Care Inspectorate's public datastore, which contains a lot of rich data about Scotland's care sector
-   you'll be putting your Power BI skills to the test on this data: what can you show us?
-   you'll be working in small groups, doing [team programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)

## Setup

-   Select `Get data from web` and supply the link: <https://github.com/NES-DEW/KIND-training/raw/refs/heads/main/bi_training/data/MDSF_data_30%20November%202024.xlsx>
-   load the `data` table and the `Field Definitions List` worksheet</br>![Load data and the Field Definitions List](images/clipboard-2485149392.png)

## Setup

-   then use `Transform data` to fix the `Field Defintions List`
    -   remove the top 4 rows
    -   promote the headers
    -   Fill down the category column

## Schedule

-   15 minutes: initial exploration of the data, and idea generation
-   5-10 minutes: re-join for troubleshoot and chat
-   15 minutes: data wrangling
-   10 minutes: break
-   20 minutes: report draft
-   10 minutes: re-join for chat
-   10 minute: polish and refine
-   until session end: showing off and suggestions

## Ideas

-   national, regional, local?
-   snapshot, or showing change over time?
-   self-contained, or linking to other open data?
-   about care in general, or something more specific?
-   about inspections, service organisers, service users?

## Conduct

-   be kind: we're all here to learn
-   I'm here throughout: message me in case of any difficulties
-   nominate one person to share their screen, and work on the report
-   other people navigate, direct, suggest, and look up
-   start small and iterate
