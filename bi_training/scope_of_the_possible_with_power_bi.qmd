## Session outline

-   this session is a **non-technical overview** designed for service leads
-   Why Power BI, and why this session?
-   Power BI demo - build a simple dashboard
-   Strengths and weaknesses
    -   obvious
    -   less obvious
-   Alternatives
-   Skill development

## Power BI?

-   newish (c.2015)
-   based on Microsoft's SQL reporting products
    -   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for
-   integrates functions from several other Microsoft data products (bits of Excel, PowerPivot, PowerQueryâ€¦)
-   produces interactive dashboards

## Why this session?

-   there is a lot of fluff talked about Power BI
    -   e.g. elaborate visualisations, fancy real-time data products...
-   Power BI in general is promoted as a no-code tool
    -   that's just not true, as we'll see
-   Power BI has a sales-y focus
    -   that conceals some of its most useful properties
-   so Power BI, as a platform, requires some translation to the complicated reality of health and social care data
    -   and Power BI offers real strengths in managing and exploiting our data, even when the pain-points are taken into account

## Power BI demo

-   using tidied of the [GP practice size dataset](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes) from April 2024
    -   [GP practice size data](%22data/apr_2024_clean.xlsx%22)
    -   [Demographic data](%22data/3%20-%20demographics.csv%22)

```{r}
readxl::read_xlsx("data/apr_2024_clean.xlsx") |>
    dplyr::slice_sample(n = 3) |>
    knitr::kable(caption = "Note this data is cleaned")
```

## Load some data

## Preview

## Add to a map

## Add interactions

![Visualisations are interactive]../src/images/clipboard-1372596463.png)

## Publish

## Add more visuals

![30-odd built in, hundreds of free additional visuals, thousands of (often dodgy) commercial add-ins]../src/images/clipboard-2549253369.png)

## Add more data

-   we could add the [health board names](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc), to make our visual more useful
-   we could also get [GP practice demographics](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-populations)

## Add more data

![Totally different data, but harmonised process for loading]../src/images/clipboard-2157605622.png)

## Re-shape that data

![Neatly-integrated PowerQuery, gives loads of scope for tidying and fixing data]../src/images/clipboard-256142195.png)

## Data modelling tools

![Full suite of relational tools for the more ambitious projects]../src/images/clipboard-1503081705.png)

## Pre-packed visuals

## Demographics

## Strengths

-   by far the easiest way of producing interactive data products
-   great tools for tidying data
-   good for iterative projects
-   data hubbing / self-service data
-   scaling
-   potential to manage complex and sensitive data on existing infrastructure

## Weaknesses

-   really needs clean and tidy data
-   publication can be complicated and expensive
-   steepening pain curve. Easy to start projects, but more involved analysis is messy
-   complex IG landscape
-   messy skills development journey
