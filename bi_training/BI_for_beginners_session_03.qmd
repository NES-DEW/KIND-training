## Session outline

If you'd like to get a sense of the core content, you might have a look at the video outline for this session:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1090010634?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="KIND network - BI for Beginners session 3"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>


+ In this session, we're going to build part of the GP practice size dashboard from last time
+ But we'll do this from raw data, rather than the play data we used last time
+ We'll bring that data in directly from the web
+ We'll need to wrangle that data to get it to behave

## Data wrangling

+ several different sources needed
  + some real [open data about GP practices ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/f23655c3-6e23-4103-a511-a80d998adb90/resource/a160fa97-8a3c-429a-9683-3835cafe1701/download/practice_contactdetails_jul2023-open-data.csv)
  + [Health board names ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/datastore/dump/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc?bom=True)
  + [Demographic data for GP practices ðŸ”—](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/datastore/dump/d7f423dd-9611-4ae9-a9c8-4dcc532ece22?bom=True)

## Load our data

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Open Power BI and start a new report
2. Use the **Get data** menu to load data from the web</br>![Get data](images/get_data.png){height="300px"}
3. Load each of the three URLs supplied in the chat
:::

## Inspect our data

+ You should have seen a preview during data loading, but you should now inspect each of the data sets via the data view
+ What will we need to do to use them to reproduce the dashboard from last time?

## Task list
+ My data came across with horrible names. Let's rename to **practices**, **boards**, and **demographics**
+ we can discard some of the **practices** data
+ we'll need to join **boards** and **practices** to get nice health board names in our dashboard
+ we'll need to re-shape **demographics**

## Wrangling

+ we'll do our data wrangling using Power Query



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. In the data view, select **Transform data**</br>![Transform data](images/transform.png)
:::

## Discarding data

+ (duty of data minimization) </br> ![Remove unnecessary columns](images/rem_col.png)
+ we can safely lose several columns:
    + **TelephoneNumber**, **PracticeType**, **Dispensing** are all spare
    + **HSPC** and **DataZone** are more directly useful, although we actually won't use them
+ you can use the applied steps box in Query Settings to review (or undo) changes to your data

## Joining data

+ there's an **HB** column in both the **boards** and **practices** data
+ we can link these up so that we can use the actual proper health board names in our dashboard



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. select the HB column and select **Merge Queries** </br> ![Merge queries](images/merge.png)
1. fill in the options in the merge pop-up </br> ![merge options](images/merge2.png){height="300px"}
1. note that this gives us lots of information about how the join is likely to work
:::


+ a slight puzzle: the join initially looks pretty unpromising </br>![nested table](images/merge3.png)
+ here, Power Query is effectively telling you that there's a table row packed into each of these cells. That row is the matching row from the boards data that matched our HB column in the practices data
+ we can unpack all or some of the columns from each row using the menu in the column header. 
+ I think we only want **HBName** - but feel free to experiment as you can always backtrack from the query settings pane

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. select the column(s) you want to keep from the column header </br> ![Select columns](images/merge4.png){height="250px"}
:::

+ you can also access lots of other Excel-ish options by right-clicking the column
+ something we can do there is to rename this column to give a nicer name (which we'll need to use later while building our visualisation)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. please rename your new column to **"HBName"**
2. note that you can also do this inside the formula bar at the top of the screen </br> ![Rename via PQM](images/merge5.png)</br>This formula is written in **Power Query M**, which we'll discuss later
3. check that you now have nice board names in the practices data
4. remember to **close & apply**
:::

## Re-shaping data
+ our demographics data is going to be hard to plot
+ we'll reshape it using Power Query to make our life easier

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. As before, please **Transform Data**
1. Use the **Select columns** tool (or delete as before) to remove the **id**, **Date**, **HSPC**, **HB**, and **SexQF** columns 
1. You can do this in Power Query directly with `= Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"_id", "Date", "HB", "HSCP", "SexQF"})`
1. Select the **PracticeCode** and **Sex** columns, then select **Unpivot Other Columns**</br>![Unpivot other columns](images/pivot_1.png){height="350px"}
:::

+ That should give us something that looks like this: </br> ![Long-form data](images/pivot_2.png)
+ we can now remove unwanted values by filtering </br>![Remove unwanted values by filtering](images/pivot_3.png){height="300px"}

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. From the **Attribute** column, please remove the **QF** rows, 
2. From the **Attribute** column, please remove the **AllAges** rows
3. From the **Sex** column, please remove the **All** rows
:::

+ the last type of reshaping to show off is about transforming values

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Split the **Attribute** column by **Digit to Non-digit**</br>![Split the attribute column](images/pivot_4.png){height="150px"}
2. replace values in the new **Attribute.1** column to remove the "Ages"
3. then in **Attribute.2**, two replacements to remove the "to"s and replace the "plus" with **99**
4. then rename the columns to **age_upper** and **age_lower**
5. finally, change the data type to **whole number** for each of those new columns
:::

## Tidying up

+ we should now be able to use this data to re-make our GP bubble map from last time.
+ there are some minor bits of tidying up that need to happen first
+ there are a few duplicate practice names, which might cause us problems </br>![Beware duplicate practice names](images/barclay.png)
+ so we'll transform each name to include the postcode to avoid this happening

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. select **Transform data**
2. add a **Custom column** called Practice Name</br> ![New custom column](images/cust_col.png){height="300px"}
3. use `&` to concatenate values: `[GPPracticeName] & " (" & [Postcode] & ")"`
4. close and apply
:::

+ Power BI likes to summarise data wherever possible
+ this can cause problems (although I don't think there's anything in this example that suffers from it)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the data view
2. In the **practices** table, note that you can change the summary options for the **PracticeListSize** column </br>![Change default summary](images/summ_list.png){height="200px"}
:::

## Re-making our visualisation

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Add a map, and set the **Postcode** to Location, **boards.HBName** to Legend, **PracticeListSize** to Bubble Size
1. Format the map to greyscale
1. Rename for this visual to suit
1. add a slicer for Health board
2. add cards for the list size and practice name
3. add a stacked column chart for practice sizes
:::

## Finishing up

+ next time, we'll use some of that data we wrangled today to extend our GP dashboard
+ **please save your file somewhere safe**
+ if you have time during the week, come back to the visualisations that we sketched today, and play. What would you like to add to the dashboard?
  + there's a lot of demographic data to play with
+ Let me know, and we'll try adding those things next time
