## Session outline

-   In this session, we’re going to build out the GP practice size dashboard from last time
-   we’re going to use some new features of Tableau to help us with that
    -   Calculated Fields
    -   Table calculations
    -   Level of Detail (LOD) expressions

## Session files

-   four .csv files
    -   [`1 - practices.csv`](data/1%20-%20practices.csv) from [PHS's opendata portal](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-contact-details-and-list-sizes)
    -   [`2 - boards.csv`](data/2%20-%20boards.csv) rom [PHS's opendata portal](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/geography-codes-and-labels/resource/652ff726-e676-4a20-abda-435b98dd7bdc)
    -   [`3b - demographics_p.csv`](data/3b%20-%20demographics_p.csv) pivoted data from [PHS's opendata portal](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/gp-practice-populations)
    -   [`4 - postcodes.csv`](data/4%20-%20postcodes.csv) from the [Scottish Postcode Directory](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/geography/our-products/scottish-postcode-directory/2024-1) - although note that the supplied file is a small subset of this larger directory


## Getting started

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   [find your dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brendan.clarke4139/viz/KIND_Tableau_for_beginners_s04/Map) from last time
    -   or create a new dashboard based on the following four data sources for this week </br>![data structure](images/clipboard-2774784522.png)
-   create a new, empty, worksheet
:::

## Calculated Fields

-   **Calculated Fields** are the basic tool used to summarize data in Tableau
-   let's start with a simple example: how big is the largest GP practice?
-   we'll answer that by writing a simple formula: `MAX([Practice List Size])`
    -   `MAX` is a function that finds the largest value in some data
    -   `[Practice List Size]` refers to one of our columns of data

## `MAX()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   right-click your `Practice List Size` field, and select `Create > Calculated Field...` </br>![select Create \> Calculated Field...](images/clipboard-834204544.png)
-   name your Calculated Field `largest_practice`
-   then use the following (case sensitive) formula to calculate the largest practice: `MAX([Practice List Size])` </br> ![Calculate the largest practice](images/clipboard-249424320.png)
:::

## Finding your calculated fields

-   note that your new `largest_practice` field will show up at the very bottom of your sets of data: </br>![Calculated field location](images/clipboard-4047316822.png)
-   note too the equals sign in the icon, indicating a calculated field

## `MIN()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   now repeat to find the smallest practice using `MIN()`</br>![Smallest practice](images/clipboard-1865594794.png)
:::

## `COUNT()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   now repeat to find the number of practices using `COUNT()`</br>![Number of practices](images/clipboard-1199492693.png)
:::

## `AVG()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   finally, find the average practice size using `AVG()`</br>![Average practice size](images/clipboard-3666195275.png)
:::

## Adding calculated fields to worksheets

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   Drag any one of your new calculated fields to Text Marks, then add `HB Name` to the column shelf: </br>![Adding calculated fields to a worksheet](images/clipboard-1921124157.png)

-   then (in a slightly quirky way) you should be able to add each calculation by double-clicking the name of the calculated field: </br> ![Double-click the calculated field to add to the worksheet](images/clipboard-2599202520.png)
:::

## Finding functions

-   from the right-click menu, you can edit calculations </br>![edit calculations](images/clipboard-2175626557.png)
-   note that the right-hand edge of the calculation interface contains a mini help section for the available functions </br>![Available functions](images/clipboard-612511174.png)

## Combining functions

-   we can use several functions in a formula to do interesting analytic work
-   we'll look at three helpers for combining functions:
    -   brackets
    -   `+`
    -   `STR()`

## Brackets

-   you can combine several functions together with brackets
-   the functions will run from the inside-out:
    -   `ROUND(AVG([dat]))` will:
        -   average `[dat]`, then
        -   round that result
        
::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   try making a rounded average of practice list size to the nearest 100
- `ROUND(AVG([Practice List Size]), -2)`
:::

## `+`

-   `+` joins text values together

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}

- create a new sheet with `HB Name` on the `Rows` shelf
- then create a new calculation with the formula `"The first practice name is " + MIN([GP Practice Name])`
- add that calcuation to `Text Marks`
- you may need to play with the `Fit` menu to see your results:</br> ![The Fit menu](images/clipboard-2278766619.png){height="200"}

:::



## `STR()`

-   if you try to use `+` to add text to numeric calculations, you'll run into a problem
-   `STR()` converts numbers to text

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   try `"The smallest practice has " + STR(MIN([Practice List Size])) + " patients"`
:::

## `IF` and friends

+ `IF something THEN action1 ELSE action2 END`
+ `ELSEIF something else THEN action2`
+ `IFF(something, action1, action2)`

## Table calculations

-   Table calculations are calculations on visualizations, rather than the underlying data
-   We'll run through a quick table calculation now

## Quick table calculations

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   build a new sheet with largest and smallest practices by board </br>![largest and smallest practices by board](images/clipboard-838239548.png)
-   right-click your largest_practice calculation, and select `Quick Table Calculation > Rank` </br>![Quick Table Calculation](images/clipboard-1483597521.png)
-   that converts largest_practice to display as a rank between 1 and 14
:::

-   clear the table calculations from the right-click menu: </br>![clear the table calculations](images/clipboard-3011197319.png)

## Level of detail calculations

-   LoD calculations allow you to control the level of detail that your calculations work at
-   this is just a taster as this gets into advanced (and messy) territory pretty fast

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
-   create a table showing the average of each demographic group per NHS board:</br>![average of each demographic group per NHS board](images/clipboard-1829421050.png)
-   now add a LoD calculation that will show the average for each attribute bracket for Scotland overall using `{FIXED [Attribute] : AVG([Value])}`:</br> ![average for each attribute bracket for Scotland overall](images/clipboard-3770245436.png)
:::

That gives us a slightly messy way of benchmarking our average for our bracket within a board to the bracket nationally: </br>![national benchmark](images/clipboard-205489057.png)

We could also try the more ambitious:

`AVG([Value]) / ATTR({FIXED [Attribute] : AVG([Value])})`

(you need the `ATTR` function to trick Tableau into mixing and matching these different values)
