<section id="current-schedule" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="current-schedule">Current schedule</h2>
<p>Most KIND training happens in six-week core training blocks that repeat four times per year. Most of our training - especially the Excel and Power BI courses - will be contained in those blocks. The blocks broadly align with school terms, because thatâ€™s when (empirically) we get the best attendance at training.</p>
<p>This year, those core blocks will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the late summer/early autumn, between 1st Sept and 10th Oct 2025</li>
<li>in the winter, between 3rd Nov and 12th Dec</li>
</ul>
<section id="theme-weeks" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="theme-weeks">Theme weeks</h3>
<p>Theme weeks occupy a whole week with a single topic, with 10-20 events scheduled on a single topic. This year, weâ€™ll have the following theme weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>week commencing 19th May 2025 - Power Query</li>
<li>w/c 30th June 2025 - Debugging/Troubleshooting</li>
<li>w/c 25th August 2025 - Open Source / copyleft</li>
<li>w/c 27th October 2025 - No Stupid Questions</li>
</ul>
