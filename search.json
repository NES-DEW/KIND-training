    "text": "Spurious causes\n\nIntervention: In July 2000 patients were randomised to a control group and an intervention group. A remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was said for the well being and full recovery of the intervention group.\nMain outcome measures: Mortality in hospital, length of stay in hospital, and duration of fever.\nResults: Mortality was 28.1% (475/1691) in the intervention group and 30.2% (514/1702) in the control group (P for difference=0.4). Length of stay in hospital and duration of fever were significantly shorter in the intervention group than in the control group (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively).\n\n\nThese results, however, need to be interpreted with caution. There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the most clinically important outcome (mortality), and the median values varied little between prayer and non-prayer on both length of stay (seven and eight days) and duration of fever (two days each). The religious affiliation of the person saying the prayer is not given. Many religious groups do not accept the power of prayer given by those with different beliefs. If real, the effect of prayer shown in this study may be unrelated to supernatural power and hence to a particular belief system, or may be specific to beliefs, reflecting the power inherent in a particular religion. Further work is needed in this area before conclusions can be made. (Thornett 2002)"

    "text": "Investigating data\nDplyr is usually used as a toolkit for manipulating tidy data. This session concentrates on some lesser-used functions in the dplyr package that are especially useful earlier in the analysis lifecycle when exploring new data: slice(), glimpse(), rename(), relocate(), case_when()/case_match(), and consecutive_id()\nPackage loading as follows:\n\nlibrary(NHSRdatasets)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nslice()\nIt’s definitely worth pointing you towards the slice() manual page - it’s clear and interesting.\nAt its simplest, slice() is an alternative to head:\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(1:6)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      1           21289     2879       5060\n2 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n3 2017-03-01 RF4      other        2850        6          0\n4 2017-03-01 R1H      1           30210     5902       6943\n5 2017-03-01 R1H      2             807       11          0\n6 2017-03-01 R1H      other       11352      136          0\n\n\nThe number supplied to slice() returns that row - so slice(3) shows the third row. You can also provide a sequence or vector of rows:\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(1:3)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      1           21289     2879       5060\n2 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n3 2017-03-01 RF4      other        2850        6          0\n\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(2,5,918)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-03-01 RF4      2             813       22          0\n2 2017-03-01 R1H      2             807       11          0\n3 2017-01-01 RQ6      other       10253        0          0\n\n\nMore interestingly, you can group_by(), then slice, to see the first row of each group. Here, the data is filtered, grouped by org_code, then we slice the top row of each group:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(attendances &gt;= 22000) |&gt;\n  group_by(org_code) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 6\n# Groups:   org_code [4]\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2017-10-01 R0A      1           22392     3628       6836\n2 2017-03-01 R1H      1           30210     5902       6943\n3 2019-03-01 RRK      1           32017    10670      10850\n4 2017-03-01 RW6      1           22930     4997       5328\n\n\n(we’ll explore group_by() in the summarising data with dplyr session, so don’t worry if this is unfamiliar)\nThe slice_min() and slice_max() functions are also useful, giving you something like an integrated arrange() for looking at slices of the data:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"1\") |&gt;\n  slice_max(breaches, n=1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2019-01-01 RRK      1           31935    12502      11493\n\n# equivalent to\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(breaches)) |&gt;\n  slice(1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2019-01-01 RRK      1           31935    12502      11493\n\n\n(note that you need to explicitly name the number of rows you want using n=...)\nslice_min() and slice_max() are particularly useful for groups:\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  filter(type == \"1\") |&gt;\n  group_by(org_code) |&gt;\n  slice_max(breaches, n=1) \n\n# A tibble: 140 × 6\n# Groups:   org_code [140]\n   period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2019-01-01 R0A      1           21980     6206       6985\n 2 2018-11-01 R1F      1            3810     1262        967\n 3 2017-01-01 R1H      1           28420     7426       6435\n 4 2017-01-01 R1K      1           11961     5897       4587\n 5 2019-01-01 RA2      1            6242     1071       2513\n 6 2017-01-01 RA3      1            4073     1471       1074\n 7 2016-06-01 RA4      1            3992      454       1057\n 8 2016-11-01 RA7      1            9625     2445       3064\n 9 2019-01-01 RA9      1            6056     2053       2557\n10 2019-03-01 RAE      1           10698     3438       2854\n# ℹ 130 more rows\n\n\nslice_sample() gives a random sampling of the data.\n\nae_attendances |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=6) \n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2019-03-01 RK5      1            9373      901       3033\n2 2016-04-01 RW3      1           11977     1655       3347\n3 2016-11-01 NX122    other        2701        0          0\n4 2016-09-01 RE9      other         678        4          0\n5 2017-06-01 RH5      other        8231       31          0\n6 2019-02-01 RQ6      2             464        0         22\n\n\nThere are also slice_head() and slice_tail() functions which work in the same way.\nFinal tip - slice with a negative index can be used as like filter() to remove the specified row(s):\n\n# returns the last 5 rows only\nae_attendances |&gt; \n  slice(-1:-12760)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  period     org_code type  attendances breaches admissions\n  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;fct&gt;    &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 2018-04-01 Y02584   other         471        0          0\n2 2018-04-01 RA3      1            3825      476       1016\n3 2018-04-01 AXG      other        2980       24          0\n4 2018-04-01 NLX24    other        1538        0          0\n5 2018-04-01 RA4      1            4388       82       1292\n\n\nglimpse()\nglimpse() is a data viewing function similar to print(), except it transposes the data so that each column is displayed as a row.

If you have lots of stages piped together, you can insert glimpse() in periodically to check that each stage of your transformation is working as expected:\n\nsynthetic_news_data |&gt; \n  glimpse() |&gt;\n  filter(age == 71 & male == 0) |&gt;\n  glimpse() |&gt;\n  mutate(pulse_pres = syst-dias) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 1,000\nColumns: 12\n$ male  &lt;int&gt; 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1…\n$ age   &lt;int&gt; 68, 94, 85, 44, 77, 58, 25, 69, 91, 70, 87, 93, 61, 75, 97, 80, …\n$ NEWS  &lt;int&gt; 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 7, 2, 5, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 0, 2, 1, 2…\n$ syst  &lt;int&gt; 150, 145, 169, 154, 122, 146, 65, 116, 162, 132, 110, 166, 123, …\n$ dias  &lt;int&gt; 98, 67, 69, 106, 67, 106, 42, 56, 72, 96, 85, 90, 78, 80, 72, 81…\n$ temp  &lt;dbl&gt; 36.8, 35.0, 36.2, 36.9, 36.4, 35.3, 35.6, 37.2, 35.5, 35.3, 37.0…\n$ pulse &lt;int&gt; 78, 62, 54, 80, 62, 73, 72, 90, 60, 67, 95, 87, 93, 65, 89, 145,…\n$ resp  &lt;int&gt; 26, 18, 18, 17, 20, 20, 12, 16, 16, 16, 24, 16, 26, 12, 16, 16, …\n$ sat   &lt;int&gt; 96, 96, 96, 96, 95, 98, 99, 97, 99, 97, 87, 95, 96, 96, 98, 99, …\n$ sup   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ alert &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\n$ died  &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0…\nRows: 11\nColumns: 12\n$ male  &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n$ age   &lt;int&gt; 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71\n$ NEWS  &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3\n$ syst  &lt;int&gt; 128, 128, 137, 128, 114, 106, 128, 114, 132, 137, 102\n$ dias  &lt;int&gt; 67, 81, 61, 81, 62, 56, 82, 66, 96, 78, 51\n$ temp  &lt;dbl&gt; 38.2, 37.9, 36.4, 36.2, 35.9, 36.2, 37.9, 38.2, 35.4, 37.0, 35.8\n$ pulse &lt;int&gt; 99, 101, 102, 73, 87, 72, 110, 103, 67, 102, 54\n$ resp  &lt;int&gt; 17, 18, 17, 18, 16, 15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 18\n$ sat   &lt;int&gt; 98, 96, 95, 95, 95, 97, 97, 99, 99, 95, 100\n$ sup   &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\n$ alert &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n$ died  &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\nRows: 11\nColumns: 13\n$ male       &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n$ age        &lt;int&gt; 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71, 71\n$ NEWS       &lt;int&gt; 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3\n$ syst       &lt;int&gt; 128, 128, 137, 128, 114, 106, 128, 114, 132, 137, 102\n$ dias       &lt;int&gt; 67, 81, 61, 81, 62, 56, 82, 66, 96, 78, 51\n$ temp       &lt;dbl&gt; 38.2, 37.9, 36.4, 36.2, 35.9, 36.2, 37.9, 38.2, 35.4, 37.0,…\n$ pulse      &lt;int&gt; 99, 101, 102, 73, 87, 72, 110, 103, 67, 102, 54\n$ resp       &lt;int&gt; 17, 18, 17, 18, 16, 15, 17, 14, 17, 19, 18\n$ sat        &lt;int&gt; 98, 96, 95, 95, 95, 97, 97, 99, 99, 95, 100\n$ sup        &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\n$ alert      &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n$ died       &lt;int&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n$ pulse_pres &lt;int&gt; 61, 47, 76, 47, 52, 50, 46, 48, 36, 59, 51\n\n\n\nrename() (and rename_with())\nrename() renames columns.

Can we class the total deaths into winter, and non-winter categories?

Winter/non-winter isn’t regular though, so case_when() is the better option. Here, we’ll work in stages.

I found the session helpful in validating that I was in fact using pivot tables correctly. I didn’t know about slicers or about uploading data from the web and both of those hacks will become daily use for me. The session gave me confidence in my own ability which can be a rare feeling and even let me think that I might now be an ‘advanced user’.

There’s a large (and growing) workforce responsible for this work in Scotland. However, this workforce is really diverse. It’s not like e.g. nursing or other NMHAP professions where there are fixed entry and promotion criteria. Professional development is more complicated and messy than that. A good example is the lack of standardised job titles for KIND workers. We currently have something like 350 different job titles in the Teams channel. That splitting up of job families contributes to KIND workers being less visible than I think they should be. Kathleen Grey and colleagues called them “ghosts in the machine”"

    "text": "Introduction\nMore so than in other programming languages, R functions bias towards helping the user do common tasks easily. One excellent example is the way that tidyverse functions (like dplyr) make assumptions about what users mean when they refer to variables. As an example:\n\nstranded_data |&gt; \n  select(age) \n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nWhen we specify the age column in this select function, we don’t need to tell R that we specifically mean the age column in the stranded_data tibble. That’s very helpful, because it saves us having to specify that we want to refer to a specific column in a specific tibble each time we write a line of dplyr. Even if we create another tibble that also has an age column…\n\nnew_stranded_data &lt;- stranded_data |&gt;\n  select(stranded.label, age)\n\n… we can still just refer to the age column of the original stranded_data without any risk of confusion. This simplification - which we’ll call data masking - is a great advantage of using the pipe, and most of the time data masking just works without giving rise to any problems at all. For example, we can write a vector of column names, and then pass it to select(), and R will figure out that we want to use those names as column names without any extra effort on our part:\n\nmy_cols &lt;- c(\"age\", \"care.home.referral\", \"medicallysafe\")\n\nstranded_data |&gt;\n  select(any_of(my_cols))\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 3\n     age care.home.referral medicallysafe\n   &lt;int&gt;              &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50                  0             0\n 2    31                  1             0\n 3    32                  0             1\n 4    69                  1             1\n 5    33                  0             0\n 6    75                  1             1\n 7    26                  1             0\n 8    64                  0             1\n 9    53                  0             1\n10    63                  1             0\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nThat means that cases where data masking goes wrong can be enormously frustrating, because most of the time we don’t have to think about what are code is really doing very often at all. Here’s an example of such a problem in a function that picks a specified column from stranded_data and displays it:\n\ncolumn_displayer &lt;- function(col_name) {\n  stranded_data |&gt;\n  select(any_of(col_name)) \n}\n\nIf we try to use this column_displayer() function in the normal way, we’ll receive an error:\n\ntry(column_displayer(age))\n\nError in select(stranded_data, any_of(col_name)) : \n  ℹ In argument: `any_of(col_name)`.\nCaused by error:\n! object 'age' not found\n\n\nOkay, so we can dodge this error in this case by quoting the column name when we supply it as an argument:\n\ncolumn_displayer(\"age\")\n\n# A tibble: 768 × 1\n     age\n   &lt;int&gt;\n 1    50\n 2    31\n 3    32\n 4    69\n 5    33\n 6    75\n 7    26\n 8    64\n 9    53\n10    63\n# ℹ 758 more rows\n\n\nBut this non-standard “kludge” leads to trouble when we want to, for instance, use column_displayer() inside another function. A stronger approach is to adjust our function code in the first place, so that we don’t have to call our function in a non-standard way (why write age in some functions, but “age” in others to refer to the same thing).\nIn this section, we’ll give a bit of helpful theoretical background about data masking. We’ll then go on to look at four ways of resolving some of the difficulties that data masking can cause."

    "text": "Background\nThe rlang page on data-masking is very helpful here in setting out a key distinction between kinds of variables that we’ve previously been using synonymously:\n\nenv-variables (things you create with assignment)\ndata-variables (e.g. imported data in a tibble)\n\nFor beginners, this distinction is not that important, particularly because tidyverse functions do lots of helpful blurring between these different types of variable. Note that many base R functions do often require the user to bear this distinction in mind. For instance, in base R you would specify a data variable differently from an environment variable:\n\nmtcars$cyl      # a data variable\ncyl &lt;- c(4,6,8) # an environment variable\n\nWhereas in tidyverse, you can:\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  select(cyl) # specifying a data variable like an environment variable inside select\n\nMost of the time, data masking doesn’t cause any problems. However, when you start wanting to include tidyverse functions inside other functions, that blurring raises a problem. We won’t give much of an explanation as to the reasons for this, although do read this introduction to the topic and this more detailed account if you are interested in the technical aspects. Here, we’ll concentrate on four strategies for resolving these kind of data masking problems. These strategies are:\n\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  Problem                              Solution                                 \n  &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;chr&gt;                                    \n1 data-variable in a function argument **embracing** with `{var}`             \n2 env-variable in a vector             `.data[[var]]` and `.env[[var]]` **prono…\n3 variables in output                  **injection** with **`:=`**              \n4 complex cases                        **quasiquotation** with the injection op…"

(rlang quasiquotation manual page)\n\nAnd the strength of using quasiquotation is that it grants lots of scope for handling variables in comparatively complicated function. For example, if we want to create a function to take a supplied tibble and column name, and generate a bit of Rmarkdown with a header and summary of that column, quasiquotation (and injection) allow us to wrangle our variables so that they are compatible with the tidyverse functions that we’d like to use:\n\ndistinct_entries &lt;- function(df, col_name){\n  \n  cat(glue::glue(\"#### Results for {col_name}:  \\n  \\n\")) # using glue syntax\n  \n  df |&gt; \n    select(!!sym(col_name)) |&gt; # using quasiquotation to select the supplied column\n    rename(\"distinct_{col_name}\" := col_name) |&gt; # using injection to rename the column\n    distinct() \n}\n\ndistinct_entries(ae_attendances, \"org_code\")\n\n#### Results for org_code:  \n  \n\n\n# A tibble: 274 × 1\n   distinct_org_code\n   &lt;fct&gt;            \n 1 RF4              \n 2 R1H              \n 3 AD913            \n 4 RYX              \n 5 RQM              \n 6 RJ6              \n 7 Y02696           \n 8 NX122            \n 9 RVR              \n10 RJ1              \n# ℹ 264 more rows"

That means short scripts with source(), and using functions and functional programming to avoid repetitious code\navoiding creating loads of variables (do a lot of things directly if you don’t need the data for later), and careful variable naming\nrefactoring messy code at the time to keep it clean\nkeeping code formatted nicely\n\nI see a lot of broken code, and the commonest cause by far is excessive script length and complexity.

    "text": "How is your code broken?\nMy code won’t run at all\nThis is the commonest, hard-to-solve error that most of us encounter. It usually means that R is having some unusual difficulty in recognizing the R code you’re written as being R code. It’s hard to solve because you don’t have a nice informative error message (or anything else) to look at. Things to check at this point are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of generic R troubleshooting strategies\n\n\n\n\nmake sure the last line of the console has a &gt; rather than a +. If you see +, R is waiting for you to do something. Press Esc a couple of times, then try your code again\ntry running some new code in the console (2 + 2 if more than enough)\nrestart R (Ctrl + Shift + F10)\nterminate R (Session menu)\nclose and reopen Rstudio (or hard-refresh Ctrl+F5 the page for Posit)\nmake sure the code you’re trying to run is saved as an .R file\nif you’re on the desktop, make sure you have R installed on your machine\n\ntry opening a different project and seeing if that code will run\n\n\n\nI’m getting an error message\nMost R error messages tell you what’s wrong by providing an error message in the console. In fact, many R functions will also tell you what’s gone right there too. The term of art here is that R code is generally surly - it complains a lot, even when things are going right. Here, we’re going to ignore those informative messages, and concentrate on proper errors that prevent your code from running properly.\nMy output is wonky\nThe opposite problem: your code seems to run perfectly, but you don’t get the output you’re expecting. Given that you don’t have an error message to work from, you’ll need to try and work backwards from the output you’re expecting. But a few examples of output that’s gone wrong:\n\nnumeric values are bigger/smaller than expected\ntext is incorrect, poorly-formatted, squishedtogether, or IN THE WRONG CASE\ngraphs miss values or mis-represent values\nthe possibilities are endless\n\nIn general, finding and fixing output problems is a manual business. You should expect to have output errors in new code, and it’s important to allow yourself time and space to both check for errors, and to resolve them."

    "section": "Pin-pointing problems",
    "text": "Pin-pointing problems\nTo solve an error you’ll almost always need to refine your understanding of a) what’s gone wrong, and b) where it’s gone wrong.\nRead the error message\nObvious but takes practice. Most R error messages give you clues as to how to find and fix the problem. The key here is that a) the message will contain the word Error and b) your code will stop running. Many errors from more recent packages have nice explanations and fixes. In general, the older the function, the more difficult the error. That wasn’t always the case, and some older R functions have horrid error messages. Here’s a short dictionary for some classics:\n\n\ncould not find function ‘thing’ = you’ve mis-spelled a function name or failed to load a package\n\nthere is no package called ‘glok’ = you’ve mis-spelled a package name - or you haven’t installed it\n\nobject 'mpg' not found = you haven’t created an object, or you’ve missed a pipe somewhere\n\nnon-numeric argument to binary operator = you’ve tried to do maths with words somewhere\n\nlonger object length is not a multiple of shorter object length or length of 'dimnames' [2] not equal to array extent = you’ve fallen into vector recycling rules\n\nlots of weird errors about filter - make sure you’re using dplyr::filter specifically\nFinding errors\nUnlike many programming languages, R doesn’t give you a line number for errors. It is possible, but a bit messy, to add line numbers, but might be worth it if you’re coming from Python or similar. You can usually see the malfunctioning line of code immediately above the error message in the console.\nIf your error message isn’t that helpful, you can try running the traceback() command in the console, which will show you the series of steps that led to your last error. The trick here is to read bottom-to-top: the top of the traceback() output was the last function that ran before R fell over.\nYou can also, if you’re getting desperate, try some old-fashioned print debugging, by putting some print(\"some label\") statements into your code. They’ll appear in the console, so you might be able to detect the location of your error if all else fails. But really, if you’re at this point you should probably move onto a more involved strategy…\nCheck the basic stuff\nIf that hasn’t worked, we’re into debugging proper. So, at this point, make sure that you’ve restart R to clean up your environment, run your code again, and then looked carefully at your output/error message to decide what’s wrong with it. At this point, I’d also try to write the problem down, which is an effective but irrational strategy that often seems to yield results.\nAssuming that fails, we can run through a set of quick checks that are always worth trying:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list of basic code errors\n\n\n\n\ncheck your brackets - Code &gt; Rainbow parentheses (or rainbow brackets for those of us in British-inflected English) are fantastic for this\nlook for easy transpositions like &lt; / &gt;, + / -\n\ncheck that your function names are correct, and you’re not accidentally using false-friends (class() and typeof() are really nice examples)\n\na quick check of each function’s help at this point, just to check it really does what you think it does, is highly recommended\n\n\nensure all your packages are installed and loaded. If in doubt, use namespacing package::function\n\nmake sure that you’re actually looking at this code’s output, and haven’t accidentally calculated something without showing it…\n\n\nresult &lt;- 1+5+8+9\nprint(results) # slightly different variable name"

    "section": "Isolating errors",
    "text": "Isolating errors\nIf you can’t find your problem fairly easily, then you need to cut your code down to size to make your search easier.\nMake a minimal example\nThe best advice for tricky problems is to make your problem as specific as problem. That means removing any irrelevant code. We’ll call this the minimal example. Assuming that you’ve already tried the sequence of basic troubleshooting steps above, you’d go about it as follows:\n\n\nswitch off any unnecessary parts of your code to pin down where the error is happening\n\nyou can do that by adding # or Ctrl+Shift+c\n\nor, probably cognitively better, copy the misbehaving code to a new script\n\n\ntry to run that extracted piece of code (again, probably after restarting R)\n\nyou’ll almost certainly need to load packages, and add other pieces of code to get it to run\nwhatever you do, do the minimum. No loading all the usual packages, no copy-pasting great gobbets of code around the place, just try and keep the script as simple as possible\n\n\nwhen you’ve got the code to run, you’ll either:\n\nhave the same error again, in which case you’re in a much better position to do the same thing again to localise the error within that new, simpler, script you’ve just built\nhave fixed the error, in which case you now know what you need to look elsewhere in your original code for the source of the problem\nhave given yourself a brand-new error to focus on. Lucky you! Definitely try to fix that new error before proceeding\n\n\n\nIf that doesn’t work, it’s time to look up the chain to the inputs of this piece of code. I’d work as follows:\n\ncheck for types - so if you’re expecting your code to add numbers together, ensure that your inputs are both numbers\ncheck that the variable names line up\ncheck that there’s no other code that could potentially alter any of your inputs\nfinally, repeat the isolation exercise above for each input\nReprex\n= reproducible example. See the documentation for the reprex package, especially the helpful set of do’s and don’t.\nIf the minimal example method above doesn’t find your problem, you’re probably going to need to ask for help. Luckily, the preparatory work you’ll need for that is itself directly helpful in solving your problem.\nGenerally, when people want to help you with your R code, the first thing they’ll want to do is to run it. A reprex is a way of packaging up everything your code needs so that anyone can copy and paste it. This is important, because a bare snippet of code doesn’t tell the full story. For example, say this bit of code isn’t working for me:\n\nmy_data |&gt;\n  filter(flavours = \"chocolate\") |&gt;\n  transmogrify() \n\nA potential ally and helper won’t be able to assist me with this as it stands. They won’t know about my data, they won’t know which packages I’m using, and (last line) they won’t even recognize the function name that I just made up. To save a lot of annoying back and forth, you should turn this into a minimal example (see above), and then use reprex to help your helpers. I need at least the following bits to make this code reproducible:\n\nthe data\nan idea of which package the filter() comes from\na definition of transmogrify()\n\n\nThat breaks down as follows:\n\nprovide a short snippet of data\ninclude any relevant package loading\ninclude the function definition for any non-package functions\n\n\nmy_data &lt;- dplyr::tibble(flavours = c(\"chocolate\", \"onion\", \"chocolate\"),\n                  scoop_size = c(100,120,100),\n                  count = c(200,500,400)) # give a preview of the data in a copy/pastable format\n\ntransmogrify &lt;- function(df){\n  df |&gt;\n    dplyr::summarise(total_vol_l = sum(scoop_size * count)/1000) # add the function definition\n}\n\nmy_data |&gt; # I can now run this and find the error!\n  dplyr::filter(flavours = \"chocolate\") |&gt; # dplyr's filter\n  transmogrify() \n\n\nThis usually means that you’ve used = instead of ==.\n\nGetting data together for a reprex is the most painful bit, particularly if you’re dealing with something real-world and lengthy. I like the datapasta package for this, as it has the useful function tribble_format that will take some data and turn it into a copy/pastable format that you can use in a reprex.\n\ndatapasta::tribble_format(head(mtcars, 4))"

R is a widely-used language, which means that most errors will have cropped-up in some form before. In general, I’d suggest a thorough search for your term before asking for specific help. Some search tips:\n\nlook in the help before anything online\nbe specific - mention package/function names and error messages. Often including the whole error message in quotes can sharpen things up a bit\ninclude “R” in your search string to ensure you’re getting relevant results\nyou might also use the “site: stackoverflow.com” to restrict searches to one of the most useful and relevant sources there is\n\nOtherwise, assuming this fails, you should ask for help.

Any ‘extra’ rows in simple_a are filled in with NAs. We’ve also tweaked the column names in this example, using the suffix argument.\nright_join()\n\n\nRight join\n\nright_join() includes all the rows in the second tibble:\n\nx |&gt;\n  right_join(y, by=\"key\", keep=T) \n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  category.x value.x key.x category.y value.y key.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 x                4     2 y                7     2\n2 x                4     2 y                3     2\n3 &lt;NA&gt;            NA    NA y                2     5\n4 &lt;NA&gt;            NA    NA y                2     8\n5 &lt;NA&gt;            NA    NA y                2    14\n\n\nWe get all the rows that exist in y, and any that match keys from simple_a, again, filling with NAs where appropriate. Here, we’re demonstrating the keep argument, which will repeat the column on which we’re joining for each of the tibbles.\nfull_join()\n\n\nFull join\n\nfull_join() gives us all the rows from all the tibbles:\n\nx |&gt;\n  full_join(y, by=\"key\") \n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  category.x value.x   key category.y value.y\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 x                5     3 &lt;NA&gt;            NA\n2 x                2     7 &lt;NA&gt;            NA\n3 x                4     2 y                7\n4 x                4     2 y                3\n5 x                7     1 &lt;NA&gt;            NA\n6 x                9     1 &lt;NA&gt;            NA\n7 &lt;NA&gt;            NA     5 y                2\n8 &lt;NA&gt;            NA     8 y                2\n9 &lt;NA&gt;            NA    14 y                2\n\n\nAll rows in both tibbles, filling with NAs where needed.\nanti_join()\n\n\nAnti join\n\nAnti-join is a bit of an outlier, because it returns a smaller tibble than it is supplied with. It returns all the rows of our first tibble that are not present in the second tibble:\n\nx |&gt;\n  anti_join(y, by=\"key\") \n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  category value   key\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 x            5     3\n2 x            2     7\n3 x            7     1\n4 x            9     1\n\n\nOnly those rows in x that are not present in y."

We need to make two changes to our Rmd first:\n\n\nRmarkdown\nRender code\nOutput\n\n\n\nWe add params in the header, and some code (params$name) to access their values in the body of our Rmarkdown document:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now add some params in our render code to produce a different output. Note that, as we set defaults in the Rmarkdown header, these params are optional. But if we do include params in our render call, they will over-ride the defaults:\n\n\nRmarkdown\nRender code\nOutput\n\n\n\nSame Rmarkdown:\n---\ntitle: \"Rmarkdown with params\"\noutput: html_document\nparams:\n  name: \"Bruce\" # added a param with a default value\n---\n\n```{r, results='asis'}\ncat(paste(\"Hello\", params$name)) # use that param in the body of the document\n```\n\n\n\nrmarkdown::render(\"02_rmd.Rmd\",\n                  params = list(name = \"Steve\")) # new param"

If you put some code in a file called somescript.R, you can then include that code in another script by writing: source(somescript.R). It’s as if you’d pasted the code in, but without the bulk and confusion that can cause.\nPick a structure and stick to it\nFor example, you might go with something like:\n\nscript information at the very top\nthen package loading\nthen data loading\nthen function definitions\n…\nMake your variable names sensible (and hierarchical)\nSo if you’re working with a set of data about GP practices named practices, you might create several derivative variables which would most sensibly be named:\n\npractices_count\npractices_count_grouped\npractices_largest\n…\nAdd comments and sections\n\n# all the code here has been full of comments.

    "text": "Use projects\nYou should work in projects. That’s easy to do in Posit Cloud as everything is a project. R projects help keep you organised, and prevent you having to do lots of messy and fallible work in setting working directories, supplying file paths, and wrestling with scripts when you move them.\nR thinks about a working directory, which is where it is based at the time it’s running. You can use the getwd() and setwd() to find out, or change, your working directory. But those are better avoided. If you’re working in a project, the project root is your working directory.\nProjects allow you to use relative paths with confidence - so \"data/data.csv\" describes a file named data.csv that lives in the data subdirectory of your project. Managing full paths is a nuisance in R, especially if you’re on Windows. R doesn’t like Windows file paths as they include back slashes \\. For example:C:\\my_drive\\my_code\\R_code\\data\\data.csv. If we want to use that path in R, you’ll need to tweak it to deal with the back slashes. You can either double them:C:\\\\my_drive\\\\my_code\\\\R_code\\\\data\\\\data.csv or replace them with forward slashes /: C:/my_drive/my_code/R_code/data/data.csv.\nBut definitely better to avoid full paths if at all possible. Projects make scripts portable by allowing you to ignore details specific to your computer that are hard-coded into paths etc etc. Sharing code is a key advantage of R, and you should make that as easy and fun as possible"

A nice example is when your console is showing an +, rather than a &gt;, which means means that R is waiting for input, and usually means there’s a missing bracket somewhere.\nAnother one to watch out for: there are a couple of different filter functions. If a filter isn’t working well, it’s always worth specifying which filter you want with dplyr::filter (or much more rarely stats::filter),"

Reading data to and from Excel is the most straightforward:\n\n# install.packages(\"readxl\")\nlibrary(readxl)\n# install.packages(\"readr\")\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nread_xlsx(\"data/my_dat.xlsx\") # to read data in from Excel\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  name      values\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Elizabeth      8\n2 Lorah          7\n3 Eilish        10\n4 Colin          6\n5 Robert         1\n\nread_csv(\"data/my_dat.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(total = value1 + value2) |&gt;\n  write_csv(\"data/my_output_dat.csv\") # to write data back to csv, which can be opened in Excel\n\nYou can also scale this up to read several files at once:\n\nlist.files(\"data/multifile\", full.names = T) |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv()\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n   name      value1 value2\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Elizabeth      8      7\n 2 Lorah          7      5\n 3 Eilish        10      7\n 4 Colin          6     41\n 5 Robert         1     99\n 6 Elizabeth      8      7\n 7 Lorah          7      5\n 8 Eilish        10      7\n 9 Colin          6      4\n10 Robert         1     99\n11 Elizabeth      8      7\n12 Lorah          7      5\n13 Eilish        10      7\n14 Colin          6      4\n15 Robert         1     99\n16 Elizabeth      8      7\n17 Lorah          7      5\n18 Eilish        10      7\n19 Colin          6      4\n20 Robert         1     99\n\n\nOr use a pattern option to only read some files:\n\nlist.files(\"data/\", \n           full.names = T, \n           pattern = \"my_\",\n           recursive = T)\n\n[1] \"data//multifile/my_dat - v1.csv\" \"data//multifile/my_dat - v2.csv\"\n[3] \"data//multifile/my_dat - v3.csv\" \"data//multifile/my_dat - v4.csv\"\n[5] \"data//my_dat.csv\"                \"data//my_dat.xlsx\"              \n[7] \"data//my_output_dat.csv\"        \n\n\nWriting back to a proper .xlsx file is much more involved. A good place to start would be the openxlsx package, although note that this can become quite involved pretty easily. Excel files are surprisingly complicated…\nSimilarly, if you need to read/write Word documents, you’re going to need some packages. For Word, docxtractr (as the name suggests) is helpful for extracting data, while flextable can be used to help write to docx:\n\n# install.packages(\"docxtractr\")\n# install.packages(\"flextable\")\n\nlibrary(docxtractr)\nlibrary(flextable)\n\nmtcars |&gt;\n  flextable() |&gt;\n  save_as_docx(path = \"data/word.docx\") # to write some data\n\n\n\nData in Word\n\nWe can then read this data back to show how extraction might work:\n\nmtcars_from_word &lt;- docxtractr::read_docx(\"data/word.docx\")\n\nBut, unlike Excel, we need to do some additional work to extract our data. docxtractr has identified a table, so we can convert that back into a tibble to get at its contents:\n\nmtcars_from_word |&gt;\n  docxtractr::docx_extract_tbl() |&gt;\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\nmpg\ncyl\ndisp\nhp\ndrat\nwt\nqsec\nvs\nam\ngear\ncarb\n\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.620\n16.46\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n21.0\n6\n160.0\n110\n3.90\n2.875\n17.02\n0\n1\n4\n4\n\n\n22.8\n4\n108.0\n93\n3.85\n2.320\n18.61\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.4\n6\n258.0\n110\n3.08\n3.215\n19.44\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n18.7\n8\n360.0\n175\n3.15\n3.440\n17.02\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n18.1\n6\n225.0\n105\n2.76\n3.460\n20.22\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n14.3\n8\n360.0\n245\n3.21\n3.570\n15.84\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n24.4\n4\n146.7\n62\n3.69\n3.190\n20.00\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n22.8\n4\n140.8\n95\n3.92\n3.150\n22.90\n1\n0\n4\n2\n\n\n19.2\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.30\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n17.8\n6\n167.6\n123\n3.92\n3.440\n18.90\n1\n0\n4\n4\n\n\n16.4\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n4.070\n17.40\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n17.3\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.730\n17.60\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n15.2\n8\n275.8\n180\n3.07\n3.780\n18.00\n0\n0\n3\n3\n\n\n10.4\n8\n472.0\n205\n2.93\n5.250\n17.98\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n10.4\n8\n460.0\n215\n3.00\n5.424\n17.82\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n14.7\n8\n440.0\n230\n3.23\n5.345\n17.42\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n32.4\n4\n78.7\n66\n4.08\n2.200\n19.47\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n30.4\n4\n75.7\n52\n4.93\n1.615\n18.52\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n33.9\n4\n71.1\n65\n4.22\n1.835\n19.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n21.5\n4\n120.1\n97\n3.70\n2.465\n20.01\n1\n0\n3\n1\n\n\n15.5\n8\n318.0\n150\n2.76\n3.520\n16.87\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n15.2\n8\n304.0\n150\n3.15\n3.435\n17.30\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n13.3\n8\n350.0\n245\n3.73\n3.840\n15.41\n0\n0\n3\n4\n\n\n19.2\n8\n400.0\n175\n3.08\n3.845\n17.05\n0\n0\n3\n2\n\n\n27.3\n4\n79.0\n66\n4.08\n1.935\n18.90\n1\n1\n4\n1\n\n\n26.0\n4\n120.3\n91\n4.43\n2.140\n16.70\n0\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n30.4\n4\n95.1\n113\n3.77\n1.513\n16.90\n1\n1\n5\n2\n\n\n15.8\n8\n351.0\n264\n4.22\n3.170\n14.50\n0\n1\n5\n4\n\n\n19.7\n6\n145.0\n175\n3.62\n2.770\n15.50\n0\n1\n5\n6\n\n\n15.0\n8\n301.0\n335\n3.54\n3.570\n14.60\n0\n1\n5\n8\n\n\n21.4\n4\n121.0\n109\n4.11\n2.780\n18.60\n1\n1\n4\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nReading data from pdf is much more involved, and I’d suggest exploring the pdftools package as a starting point.\nAn alternative strategy if you need to write a lot of Word/pdf documents would be Rmarkdown or Quarto. These enable you to embed R code in a proper document production tool, which is great for writing regular reports."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis is an introduction to stringdist which is designed to allow fuzzy matching of text. Install and attach in the standard way:\n\n# install.packages(\"stringdist\") # likely needs compiling\nlibrary(stringdist) \nlibrary(ggplot2) # for something fun later\n\nWhile there are several families of functions in the package, we’ll concentrate on those that focus on the core idea: strings differ, and you can quantify those differences for pleasure and profit. A simple example:\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"think\")\n\n[1] 1\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"string\")\n\n[1] 2\n\nstringdist(\"thing\", \"oxpecker\")\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nOnce you’ve got an idea about how different you’re okay with your strings being, you can use e.g. a max distance as a cut-off to do work in your code. A simple example of implementing this can be found in the amatch function, which is designed to work like a fuzzy matching version of base-R’s match. We’ll use a and b as variable names to keep aligned with the stringdist documentation. Quick refresher on match:\n\na &lt;- \"the\" # take a value\nb &lt;- c(\"this\", \"is\", \"the\", \"thing\") # and a vector of possible values\nmatch(a, b) # match returns the index location of your a in your b\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nMatch lets you do useful work with strings - e.g. remove everything before your key word:\n\nb[match(a, b):length(b)]\n\n[1] \"the\"   \"thing\""

In this section, we’ll look at some examples of tidyselect, which is a series of functions that allow you to specify columns by various patterns. Not only does this give you lots of ways of simplifying and streamlining your code, but it’s also a great way of making your code more portable - so that it works well inside functions, or across different data sets.\nIn the tidyevaluation training session, we look across this material in much more depth. There’s quite a lot to absorb, so I would definitely recommend using the manual pages (using ??tidyselect) as a reference for this section.\nPackage loading is just:\n\nlibrary(NHSRdatasets) # for sample data\nlibrary(dplyr)"

There’s no exact counterpart of R’s vectorized functions:\n\ndouble_numbers_loop = []\n\nfor n in numbers_list:\n    double_numbers_loop.append(n * 2)\n\ndouble_numbers_loop\n\n[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]\n\n\nList comprehension\nLike a lovely lightweight loop syntax\n\ndouble_numbers_list =  [n*2 for n in numbers_list]\ndouble_numbers_list\n\n[10, 8, 6, 4, 2]\n\n# and, more fancy...\ndouble_even_numbers_list =  [n*2 for n in numbers_list if (n%2 == 0) ]\ndouble_even_numbers_list\n\n[8, 4]\n\n\n\n\n\nBy and large, R is at its best with vectorized functions:\n\ndouble_numbers_vector &lt;- numbers_vector * 2\ndouble_numbers_vector\n\n[1]  2  4  6  8 10\n\n\nLoops are possible too\n\ndouble_numbers_loop &lt;- vector(\"numeric\", length = length(numbers_vector))\n\nfor (i in numbers_vector) {\n  double_numbers_loop[i] &lt;- i * 2\n}\n\nR has copy-on-modify semantics, and so care needs to be taken to avoid writing poorly-performing loops. That means that loops are used comparatively rarely in R."

Regex, as the wikipedia page suggests, have been around for ages - positively archaeological in computing terms. So for the book of the week this week, I wanted to show off one of the most interesting bits of social history I've read: Tom Lean's Electronic Dreams. Lots of the history of computing is either primarily about the technical details, or is a broadly nostalgic look at obsolete tech. This book doesn't do either of those, instead spending its time giving a concise account of how personal computing worked as a social phenomenon. For example, how did people start getting paid to write computer games? What happened when the BBC got involved in personal computing? What happened to the various promises of digital revolutions as a replacement for manufacturing industries.\"\n\nbotw[5,] |&gt;\n  select(Author, Year) # subsetting by index and columns and returning a tibble\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  Author   Year \n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;\n1 Tom Lean 2016 \n\nbotw |&gt;\n  filter(Year &gt; 2010) |&gt;\n  arrange(Year) #

Here, we estimate the position of each postcode by taking an average of the location of each building to which it refers. That’s known as a centroid, and this data contains latitude and longitude data for each postcode centroid, which is produced using the PostcodesioR R package."
