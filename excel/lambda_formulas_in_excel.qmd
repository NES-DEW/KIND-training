## Welcome

-   🌶🌶 this session is for intermediate Excel users
-   you'll **need** M365 Excel (either web or desktop) to follow along
    -   earlier versions of Excel don't have the `LAMBDA` function that we'll need
    -   you'll also need to be pretty fluent with formulas, and know a bit about naming things in Excel

## Session outline

-   this session is based on our [Excel skill-builder](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/71690) course
-   quick introduction to lambda formulas
-   `LAMBDA()`
-   two practical examples
-   use-cases, and tips for applications

## Introduction

-   lambda formulas are a way of repeating complicated Excel formulas safely
-   fairly new - M365 Excel only
-   odd, rather than hard to implement

## `LAMBDA`

![Microsoft's summary of LAMBDA](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/627806f0-40f4-4a27-86d1-4ef77a86331c.png)</br>

1.  take an existing formula
2.  work out what the inputs are - usually, which cells are referenced
3.  add one parameter per input
4.  do a calculation with those parameters
5.  name and save that formula

## Making a lambda function (setup)

-   put some random numbers in `A3` and `B3`
-   we could calculate `A3` \* `B3` directly
-   but imagine we want to convert `= A3 * B3` to a lambda

## Making a lambda function

-   start with the lambda outline in `D3`
    -   `= LAMBDA()`
-   next, add **test values in a second set of brackets**
    -   `= LAMBDA()(A3, B3)`
-   we now invent parameter names (like variable names) for each of those values, and add them
    -   `= LAMBDA(n_1, n_2, )(A3, B3)`
-   then add the formula that we want to replicate
    -   `= LAMBDA(n_1, n_2, n_1 * n_2)(A3, B3)`

## Saving a lambda function

-   once you've tested and checked your lambda with a range of test values, copy your lambda formula (without the test values in the second brackets)
-   then open the name manager (`Ctrl` + `F3`)
-   create a new name, then name your lambda definition using the **New Name** interface
-   paste your lambda into the **Refers to:** section
    -   omit the test values - so just `= LAMBDA(n_1, n_2, n_1 * n_2)`
-   test your new lambda function

## Lambda functions

-   a real-ish example: converting [CHI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service_Central_Register) to DoB
-   put an example CHI into G2 (like `1610790854`)
-   you can use the following 😱 formula: `=DATE(IF(RIGHT(LEFT(G2, 6), 2) > RIGHT(YEAR(TODAY()), 2), 19, 20) & RIGHT(LEFT(G2, 6), 2), MID(LEFT(G2, 6), 3, 2), LEFT(LEFT(G2, 6), 2))`
-   that's a horrifying thing to paste about, so we can make this into a lambda
-   test version `=LAMBDA(chi, DATE(IF(RIGHT(LEFT(chi, 6), 2) > RIGHT(YEAR(TODAY()), 2), 19, 20)&RIGHT(LEFT(chi, 6), 2), MID(LEFT(chi, 6), 3, 2), LEFT(LEFT(chi, 6), 2)))(G2)`
-   name manager then to `CHI_TO_DOB`

## Use-cases, and tips for applications

-   making workbooks less complicated
    -   names and lambda formulas are a strong combo
-   standardising (and user-proofing) complex formulas
-   lambdas are local, so you need to think laterally to re-use them
    -   make a new blank sheet, and right-click the sheet tab
