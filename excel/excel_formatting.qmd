This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) 
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd) (this session)
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)		

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers formatting in Excel:

![KIND Excel beginner skill tree](images/clipboard-4054981329.png)

-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files)
-   you'll also need to be familiar with A1 referencing, values, and tables
-   we're going to avoid talking about formulas as much as possible today
- you might find the list of [Excel shortcuts helpful too](excel_shortcuts.qmd)

-   accessibility
-   formatting cells
-   formatting values (aka **number formatting**)
-   formatting vs other things
-   shortcuts and tips
-   an introduction to conditional formatting

## Accessibility

-   many of us will have legal duties to make parts of our services accessible
    -   e.g. [The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) Accessibility Regulations 2018](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/852/contents/made)
-   there are [useful standards for making sense of accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)

## Excel is a mixed bag for accessibility

-   it is easy to make non-accessible documents in Excel
    -   merged and split cells
    -   inconsistent use of tables
    -   poor column headings, sheet names, etc
    -   unlabelled charts
    -   low-contrast themes
    -   meaning conveyed by colour and fonts
-   there is a [built-in accessibility checker in some versions of Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/accessibility-best-practices-with-excel-spreadsheets-6cc05fc5-1314-48b5-8eb3-683e49b3e593), which you might find useful

## Formatting cells

-   please create a new Excel workbook
-   you can format each cell individually via the right click menu and `Format cells` (or by the `Ctrl` + `1` shortcut) </br>![Format cells](images/clipboard-4055118942.png){height="400"}

## Format cells dialogue

![Format cells dialogue](images/clipboard-2783553285.png){height="150"}

-   you can fill cells with custom fonts, alignments, colours, patterns, and gradients (via `Fill Effects...`)
-   you can add borders to individual cells

## Formatting many cells

-   this is fine for a few cells, but gets boring (and inconsistent) if you have lots of styling to do
-   you can select several cells, and access the `Format cells dialogue` to style them together
-   or you can select a cell with a theme you want to copy, and use the `Format Painter` tool to spread that format about the place </br> ![Format Painter](images/clipboard-1122732356.png)

## Theming

-   you can also **theme** your whole workbook </br> ![theme your whole workbook](images/clipboard-3790842491.png)
-   take care, though, as many of these themes are not accessible and often produce hard-to-read results
-   and lots of ugly clunky stuff to find (e.g. default font changes)
-   on balance, better to avoid themes unless you're certain they'll be of benefit for you

## Help! I hate my formatting!

-   `Clear` \> `Clear Formats` (or `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F`) </br>![Clear Formats](images/clipboard-2778290463.png)
-   note this doesn't clear out all the formatting from themes - especially odd fonts etc
-   also worth having the `Paste as Values` trick in your back pocket for when things go horribly wrong </br>![Copy and paste](images/clipboard-2009747898.png){height="200"} ![Then select Paste as Values to remove everything but the values themselves](images/clipboard-1815980106.png)

## Number formatting

- number formatting is taking a value, and changing its meaning with formatting
- number formatting is how dates work (or fail to work) in Excel
- dates are v. important, so we'll concentrate on them in this part of the session
- you'll also encounter number formatting when working with...
    -   money
    -   percentages
    -   decimal places
    -   ...

## Date formatting

-   we'll take a number, and apply special formatting to it to make it look like a date
    -   so `45483` will become `10/07/2024`
-   Excel dates are stored as the number of days since Jan 1st 1900
-   you can prove this to yourself by typing `1` into a cell, then formatting it as a date using the number formatting menu: </br>![Formatting 1 as a date](images/clipboard-4127875250.png){height="300"}
-   you can also format as a date via the Format Cells dialogue (`Ctrl` + `1`)

## Don't try and cheat with dates!

-   date formatting is one of the commonest pain points in Excel
- dates are extremely complicated, and we often want to calculate with them
-   the advice is simple: dates should always be stored as these numbers, and then formatted to look like dates
    - don't try to cheat by writing dates as text
    - use formatting to produce your preferred date format in the  Format Cells tools instead </br>![Format Cells](images/clipboard-1573227329.png){height="200"}

## Formatting vs other things

(or, keep your sheets clean)

-   it's common to see Excel sheets that contain lots of extraneous bits
    -   headers, copyright info, explanations...
-   ideally, all this extra stuff should be kept well away from your data, as it makes it harder to process that data safely
-   ...and you should definitely be using tables to help with this

## Conditional formatting

-   this can get complicated, and we'll revisit more fancy conditional formatting in the intermediate training sessions
-   the big idea is that conditional formatting alters the format as values change

## Progress bars
-   Put a few random numbers in a column ![Put a few random numbers in a column](images/clipboard-1315843620.png){height="100"}

-   Select them, and go to the Conditional Formatting menu ![go to the Conditional Formatting menu](images/clipboard-867757489.png){height="50"}

-   Select Data Bars </br>![Select Data Bars](images/clipboard-83873237.png){height="300"}

## Duplicate values
-   Now clear that conditional formatting </br>![Clear conditional formatting](images/clipboard-199897657.png){height="300"}
-   Add a duplicate value to your numbers </br> ![Add a duplicate value to your numbers](images/clipboard-3663616570.png){height="150"}

## Duplicate values
-   Highlight duplicate values </br>![Highlight duplicate values](images/clipboard-3254436237.png)

## Red-Amber-Green reporting
-   RAG reporting with icon sets </br>![RAG reporting with icon sets](images/clipboard-2465658889.png)

## Key shortcuts

-   `Ctrl` + `1` for the Format Cells dialogue
-   `Alt`, `H`, `E`, `F` to clear formats
-   `Ctrl` + `v`, `Ctrl`, `v` to paste values only

## Formatting tips

-   Accessibility is much more important than beauty
-   Use number formatting for dates, currency, percentages
-   Consider using validation to make sure that cells only contain what you expect them to contain
-   Consider locking cells to protect formatting when that formatting is really important
-   Use conditional formatting sparingly
