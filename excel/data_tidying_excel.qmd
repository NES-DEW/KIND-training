## Welcome

-   this session is ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ - for intermediate Excel users
-   materials can be found on our training pages: **tinyurl.com/kindtrp**
-   you'll need Excel, ideally M365 desktop to follow along
- you'll also need the [sample data](https://nes-dew.github.io/KIND-training/excel/src/tidy_data_excel.xlsx)
  
## Session outline

-   understanding tidy data
-   a practical introduction to making tidy data
  -   tables
  -   autofill
  - text to columns
- validation, manual reshaping, and PowerQuery demo

## Understanding tidy data

![R4DS Figure 5.1: The following three rules make a dataset tidy: variables are columns, observations are rows, and values are cells, via CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 US](images/clipboard-3584154739.png)

-   tidy data is not specific to Excel (e.g. this session is partly adapted from [chapter 5 of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy))
-   if we tidy our data, we'll be able to compute it
-   standards for tidying data help make for safe and effective analysis



## Values

-   `values` is the word we use to describe each bit of information in an Excel spreadsheet. Some examples:
  -   a date, like `2024-06-28`
-   a number, like `11.2`
-   a name, like `NHS Grampian`
-   a cost, like `Â£12.50`
-   ...
-   each value should have its own cell

## Entering values

-   how would you enter this data: `2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022`?
  -   please now:
  -   open Excel
-   start a new workbook
-   add a column header `year` in cell `A1`
-   then add each of those five values in the five cells underneath (down to `A6`)

## More values

-   we're going to be using some [birthrate data from the NRS](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/general-publications/vital-events-reference-tables/2022) for this session. We'll start by adding some birth rate data
-   this is given as births per 1,000 women in five year age brackets. We'll start with 25-29 year old mothers
  - please add the header `25-29yrs` in cell `B1`
  - here are the values for our five years: `73.4, 71, 66.8, 69.6, 66.7`

## Tables

-   you should keep your new data in a **table**
-   `Insert` \> `Table` </br> ![Or you might prefer the Ctrl + T shortcut](images/clipboard-3262660351.png)
-   tables allow you to sort and filter your data
-   they also act as a useful 'container' (or **data structure**) for your data

## Extending tables

| 30-34yrs |
|----------|
| 90.9     |
| 88.6     |
| 83.4     |
| 85.9     |
| 84.4     |

-   please could you add some new data to your table showing births for another age group
-   you should be able to drag the blue table corner over your new column to extend the table </br>![blue table corner](images/clipboard-99329456.png)

## Autofill

-   one last way of adding values: autofill
-   drag again to make a new empty column, and label it `difference`
-   in `D2` (the first 'proper' cell), copy this formula: `=C2-B2`. This will calculate the difference in birth rates between the two columns
-   finally, click the small green corner of that newly-filled cell to autofill the column ![small green corner](images/clipboard-1736118371.png)

## Back to tidy data

-   we've now got some data with:
  -   each value in a cell
-   each variable in a column
-   here, this is a maternal age bracket
-   each observation in a row
-   here, this is a year
-   we could work through and extend this data by hand, but we'll now switch over to some supplied data to save all the typing
    -   errors are common in manual data-entry
    -   if you can import data, that's usually better than re-typing it

## Many values per cell

-   We often find useful data with more than one value per cell
-   this can be helpful for humans </br> ![multiple values is good for humans, but bad for Excel](images/clipboard-1363924537.png)
-   Excel can't do anything with this data

## Exercise one: many values per cell

-   find the `Exercise one` sheet in the exercise file
-   try calculating an average for each of the groups
-   or, if you're more confident, try plotting the data

## Nothing works!

![Divide by zero errors in the averages](images/clipboard-2726354511.png) </br> ![Plots produce pure nonsense](images/clipboard-945883446.png)

## What's the solution?

-   make this data have **one value per cell**
  -   we could remove all the percentages by hand - but that's going to be very slow
-   `Text to Columns` gives us a better tool for the job </br> ![Text to Columns gives us a better tool for the job](images/clipboard-3594403318.png)

## Text to Columns

-   select a column
-   in the `Data` tab of the ribbon, you should find the `Text to Columns` tool </br> ![Text to Columns tool](images/clipboard-3002655192.png)
-   note that you can keep, or remove, the percentage column. We'll **skip** it, to keep things simple </br> ![keep, or remove, the percentage column](images/clipboard-4061284093.png)

## Try working with that data again

![We can plot the data now](images/clipboard-3377421044.png)

## Exercise two: transposed data

-   sometimes you'll find data where the columns and rows have been flipped </br> ![data where the columns and rows have been flipped](images/clipboard-2760486038.png)
-   that's slow to fix by hand, but luckily you can **transpose it**, which swaps rows and columns
-   select your data, and copy/paste into a new cell
-   then use the transpose option <br>![transpose option](images/clipboard-3580893754.png)
-   you might need to fix formatting and labels: ![fix formatting and labels](images/clipboard-3017525992.png) </br>
  -   the `Clear formats` option might help this ![Clear formats](images/clipboard-2927420900.png)
-   if you run into trouble, please note that transposing only works on data [that is not in a table](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/transpose-rotate-data-from-rows-to-columns-or-vice-versa-3419f2e3-beab-4318-aae5-d0f862209744)

## Validation and really messy data

-   one of the most time-consuming bits of tidying is checking your values
-   we'll briefly demonstrate the **data validation** tool </br> ![the data validation tool](images/clipboard-622908428.png)
- you can follow-along from the `Demo one (validation)` worksheet
-   this allows you to describe what format you think your data should be in, and then highlights anything that doesn't fit
-  we select the `years` column
-   then open the data validation tool
-   then set appropriate validation options, so **Whole number** between 2010 and 2030 </br> ![set appropriate validation options](images/clipboard-665473732.png)
-   then select `Circle Invalid Data` </br> ![select Circle Invalid Data](images/clipboard-1528491886.png)
-   we can now go through and fix anything circled

## Reshaped data

-   there are several automated ways of reshaping data that's not in a tidy format
-   we'll look at the manual way here, but - as it's horrible - I'd be keen to encourage you to investigate Power Query or Pivot Tables to reshape if this is a regular part of your working day. PQ takes \< 10 seconds, PT not much longer
- you can follow-along from the `Demo two (reshaping)` worksheet

## Manual reshape

-   sort the data by year </br>![sort the data by year](images/clipboard-3321721696.png)
-   then copy and paste blocks of data, making sure to keep the years aligned </br>![copy and paste blocks of data](images/clipboard-2841186181.png)
-   make sure you then copy the age brackets to label the column </br>![copy the age brackets to label](images/clipboard-1151172294.png)
-   then delete the spare years columns, and the age brackets </br>![delete the spare years](images/clipboard-1265051366.png)
