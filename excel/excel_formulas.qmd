This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) 
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd) 
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd) 
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd) (this session)		 

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers formulas in Excel:

-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files)
-   you'll also need to be familiar with A1 referencing, values, and tables
-   we're going to avoid talking about formatting as much as possible today
- you might find the list of [Excel shortcuts helpful too](excel_shortcuts.qmd)

## Session outline

-   values and formulas
-   simple functions
-   references in formulas

## Values and formulas

-   cells in Excel contain either values, or formulas
-   we'll start with some data derived from [NRS 2022 population estimates](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-22/mid-year-pop-est-22-data.xlsx)
-   make sure [you have the sample data](src/excel_formulas.xlsx) available

## Values

![Example value, showing identical cell contents and formula bar contents](images/clipboard-3551345224.png)

-   when you enter some data in a cell, we call that a **value**
-   values look the same in their cell as in the formula bar

## Formulas

-   we can also make a value using a formula
-   Excel evaluates/calculates the formula, then displays the result as a value
-   in an empty cell, try entering `= 2 + 2`


![Example formula, showing different cell contents and formula bar contents](images/clipboard-3551345224b.png)

## Example formulas

-   we can do ordinary arithmetic in formulas `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`...
-   you can also try `&` which joins values
    -   `= "This number is " & 5`

## Functions

-   But most formulas use functions, which are like the verbs of Excel
-   Try `= SUM(2, 2)`

## Adding functions

-   you can type functions in by name (as above)

-   you can also add from the `Formulas` area of the ribbon </br>![add from the Formulas area of the ribbon](images/clipboard-4177249094.png)

-   or you can use the $fx$ button by the formula bar </br>![use the fx button by the formula bar](images/clipboard-2091819162.png)

## Function arguments

-   adding a function by $fx$ or the menu brings up the **Function Arguments** interface </br>![Function Arguments interface](images/clipboard-2410234964.png)

-   This is a helpful builder for more complicated functions

## What are arguments?

+   **arguments** are the values we supply to a function 
    
    + in `=SUM(2,3)`, the arguments are `2` and `3`
+   we separate arguments with a comma `,`
+   we need to be sure we're supplying the right arguments in the right order (this gets described as the **syntax** of a function)
+   we also, while we're on the jargon, say that functions **return** a value so `= SUM(4,3)` will return `7`

## Useful simple functions

-   in the same way as `=SUM()`, you can try:
    -   `AVERAGE`
    -   `MIN` and `MAX`
    -   `SUBSTITUTE`
    -   `CEILING`
    -   `TODAY`
    -   `ROUND`

## References in formulas

-   mostly, you won't add values directly into your formulas
-   instead, you'll bring them in from another part of your spreadsheet
-   can you use `SUM()` to make a total `Male` + `Female` column in the supplied data?
    -   add a header in cell `G2`
    -   if needed, extend the table to include your new column
    -   in `G3`, enter the formula `= SUM(C3, D3)`
    -   then copy down the rows by double-clicking the green fill handle ![green fill handle](images/clipboard-4213326820.png)

## Practice

-   calculate what proportion of your total population is under 16 (thanks, Lara Paterson (NHS Lanarkshire))
- estimate the population density
- find an average area for each council area

## Troubleshooting functions

-   `#NAME?` = "I don't recognise that function name"
-   `#VALUE!` = "Your syntax has gone wrong - usually in the wrong order"
-   `#REF!` = "I don't recognise that reference"
-   `#DIV/0!` = "You've divided by zero"
