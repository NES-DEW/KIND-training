## Introduction

This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of seven linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) 
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd) 
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd) 
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd) (this session)		 
+ and a final [practical review](excel_practical_review.qmd) session to help you put your new skills to work

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers formulas in Excel:

-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files)
-   you'll also need to be familiar with A1 referencing, values, and tables
-   we're going to avoid talking about formatting as much as possible today
- you might find the list of [Excel shortcuts helpful too](excel_shortcuts.qmd)

## Session outline

-   values and formulas
-   simple functions
-   references in formulas

## Values and formulas

-   cells in Excel contain either values, or formulas
-   we'll start with some data derived from [NRS 2022 population estimates](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/population-estimates/mid-22/mid-year-pop-est-22-data.xlsx)
-   make sure [you have the sample data](src/excel_formulas.xlsx) available

## Values

![Example value, showing identical cell contents and formula bar contents](../src/images/clipboard-3551345224.png)

-   when you enter some data in a cell, we call that a **value**
-   values look the same in their cell as in the formula bar

## Formulas

-   we can also make a value using a formula
-   Excel evaluates/calculates the formula, then displays the result as a value
-   in an empty cell, try entering `= 2 + 2`


![Example formula, showing different cell contents and formula bar contents](../src/images/clipboard-3551345224b.png)

## Example formulas

-   we can do ordinary arithmetic in formulas `/`, `*`, `-`, `+`...
-   you can also try `&` which joins values
    -   `= "This number is " & 5`

## Functions

-   But most formulas use functions, which are like the verbs of Excel
-   Try `= SUM(2, 2)`

## Adding functions

-   you can type functions in by name (as above)
-   you can also add from the `Formulas` area of the ribbon </br>![add from the Formulas area of the ribbon](../src/images/clipboard-4177249094.png)
-   or you can use the $fx$ button by the formula bar </br>![use the fx button by the formula bar](../src/images/clipboard-2091819162.png)

## Function arguments

-   adding a function by $fx$ or the menu brings up the **Function Arguments** interface </br>![Function Arguments interface](../src/images/clipboard-2410234964.png)
-   This is a helpful builder for more complicated functions

## What are arguments?

+   **arguments** are the values we supply to a function 
    + in `=SUM(2,3)`, the arguments are `2` and `3`
+   we separate arguments with a comma `,`
+   we need to be sure we're supplying the right arguments in the right order (this gets described as the **syntax** of a function)
+   we also, while we're on the jargon, say that functions **return** a value so `= SUM(4,3)` will return `7`

## Useful simple functions

-   in the same way as `=SUM()`, you can try:
    -   `AVERAGE`
    -   `MIN` and `MAX`
    -   `SUBSTITUTE`
    -   `CEILING`
    -   `TODAY`
    -   `ROUND`

## References in formulas

-   mostly, you won't add values directly into your formulas
-   instead, you'll bring them in from another part of your spreadsheet
-   can you use `SUM()` to make a total `Male` + `Female` column in the supplied data?
    -   add a header in cell `G2`
    -   if needed, extend the table to include your new column
    -   in `G3`, enter the formula `= SUM(C3, D3)`
    -   then copy down the rows by double-clicking the green fill handle ![green fill handle](../src/images/clipboard-4213326820.png)

## Practice

- calculate what proportion of your total population is under 16 (thanks, Lara Paterson (NHS Lanarkshire))
- estimate the population density
- find an average area for each council area

## Troubleshooting functions

-   `#NAME?` = "I don't recognise that function name"
-   `#VALUE!` = "Your syntax has gone wrong - usually in the wrong order"
-   `#REF!` = "I don't recognise that reference"
-   `#DIV/0!` = "You've divided by zero"
