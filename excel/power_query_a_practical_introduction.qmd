## Welcome

-   🌶 this session is a beginner-level introduction to PowerQuery
-   you'll either Excel desktop (\>2007) or Power BI desktop
-   you'll also need to have basic competency in Excel or Power BI
-   this session is based on our [Power BI for Beginners](https://learn.nes.nhs.scot/70921) course
-   but PowerQuery isn't specific to Power BI - it's brilliant for Excel too

## Session outline

-   what is PowerQuery, and why might you use it?
-   getting data into PowerQuery
-   basic data wrangling
-   joins (merges)
-   pivots

## What is PowerQuery?

-   Microsoft call it a ["data transformation and data preparation engine"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/power-query-what-is-power-query)
-   it's been around since 2010, initially in Excel, and then in both Excel and Power BI
-   uses code ([M Formula language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Query)) but has GUI tools for most tasks

## How I think of PowerQuery

-   the right way to load any real data into Excel

## Why might you use it?

-   powerful
-   easy, to start with at least...
-   allows you to standardise data loading from different sources
-   allows you to repeat data loading

## Getting data into PowerQuery

::: panel-tabset
### Excel

1.  Open Excel and create a new, blank, workbook
2.  `Data` \> `Get & Transform Data` </br> ![Get & Transform Data](images/clipboard-2636372440.png)
3.  Pick `From Web` and supply the following URL - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-25/scurvy.csv`
4.  From the preview, select `Transform data` to open PowerQuery

### Power BI

1.  Open Power BI and start a new report
2.  Select `Get data` \> `From Web` button in the ribbon ![Get data from web](images/clipboard-2012149707.png){height="200"}
3.  Supply the following URL - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-07-25/scurvy.csv` </br>![supply a URL](images/clipboard-1484642386.png)
4.  From the preview, select `Transform data` to open PowerQuery </br> ![Select Transform data to open PowerQuery](images/clipboard-4163607856.png)
5.  If you've already got some data in your report that you'd like to transform, use `Tranform data` in the ribbon to open PowerQuery: </br> ![Tranform data in the ribbon](images/clipboard-1924567552.png)
:::

-   this is historical data about scurvy testing from the [medicaldata r package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/medicaldata/index.html)

## Preview your Data

![make sure to click Transform data](images/clipboard-2984247945.png) </br> (make sure to click `Transform data`)

## First view of PowerQuery

![First view of PowerQuery](images/clipboard-1738142120.png)

-   Queries (= datasets) on the left
-   ribbon menu at the top
-   Query settings (= the changes you'll make to your data) on the right
-   Excel-ish data preview in the middle

## Basic data wrangling

-   right click the `study_id` column and select `Remove`
    -   the column will disappear
    -   but you'll also gain a step in your Applied Steps field </br>![](images/clipboard-1788638263.png)
-   you can edit this step
    -   if you're code-confident, you can edit the formula to read `= Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"study_id", "treatment"})` to also remove the treatment column
    -   and you can remove the step using the X next to the step name ![](images/clipboard-3939638955.png)
-   you should also try renaming and reordering your columns in the same way
-   once you've had a play, please remove the steps until you're left with the data you started with (so delete back to "Changed Type")

## Replacing values

-   we can also work with individual values
-   our values are a number, then an underscore, then a word
-   we can `Split column` at the underscore
-   we could also replace the odd underscores in the treatment column

## Reshaping data

-   we could go column by column here splitting, but an easier approach would be to re-shape the data
-   select the first three columns, and select `Unpivot Other Columns` </br>![](images/clipboard-1884864280.png)
-   then split, change type, and generally tidy up

## Add columns

Our treatment and dosing columns are annoying. Let's make a new, joined, column for them:

-   select `Custom Column`</br>![Custom Column](images/clipboard-1596515682.png)
-   you can click the gearwheel next to the step if you'd like to go back and tweak

## Close and load / Close and Apply sends your data back to Excel/Power BI

![](images/clipboard-2525392040.png)

## Getting more fancy: a bigger dataset

-   please load the [Health and Care Experience survey results from 2023-4](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/statistics/2024/05/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-results-by-geography/documents/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-geographical-data/health-and-care-experience-survey-2023-to-2024-geographical-data/govscot%3Adocument/Health%2Band%2BCare%2BExperience%2BSurvey%2B2023%2Bto%2B2024%2B-tables%2Bof%2Bresults%2Bby%2Bgeography.xlsx)</br> ![](images/clipboard-738553132.png)
-   or [alternative local version](https://github.com/NES-DEW/KIND-training/raw/main/excel/src/HACE_2023-4.xlsx)
-   please load both the proper datasets (and ignore the background)</br> ![Load both the proper datasets](images/clipboard-4050914485.png){height="200"}

## A challenge

Can you find the number of responses to each question for your local NHS board? You should be able to re-work this data to give something like: ![](images/clipboard-3334683078.png)

### Some hints

-   filtering works like Excel, but is destructive
-   unpivoting, doing something to all the rows, then re-pivoting is a great way to work across lots of columns
-   you can join structurally similar datasets using `Append Queries as New`</br>![Append Queries as New](images/clipboard-3061387544.png)
-   you can deduplicate entire datasets by selecting all the columns and using `Remove Rows` \> `Remove Duplicates`
