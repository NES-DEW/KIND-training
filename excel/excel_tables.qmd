This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) 
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd) 
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd) (this session)
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)		

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers tables in Excel:

-   for this session, you'll need to be familiar with the Excel basics (getting around in Excel, opening/saving/closing files, A1 referencing, and values)
-   we're going to dodge formatting and formulas as much as possible today
- you might find the list of [Excel shortcuts helpful too](excel_shortcuts.qmd)

-   pass data to other tools

## Introduction

-   this is an easy session to sum up: **use tables in Excel**
-   most people don't use Excel tables
-   they're probably the best Excel skill investment there is
-   this is a practical session, so you'll need some kind of Excel to follow along

## A way of thinking about tables

+ imagine you have several columns of data
+ you can think of a table as a container for that data: </br>![Table lunchbox](images/lunchbox.jpg)
+ like the lunchbox, putting data in a table helps keep your data tidy
+ tables also protect your data, and make it easier to move from place to place

## Some data

-   tables are potentially useful throughout the life-cycle of an Excel file
-   let's start at the beginning:
    1.  open Excel
    2.  in a new worksheet, please enter today's date
        1.  DD/MM/YYYY format is best, but we'll park that for the formatting session </br> ![Enter a date in a cell](images/clipboard-3905090772.png)

## Add a table

1. make sure you have that date selected
1.  In the ribbon menu, go to `Insert` `>` `Table` </br> ![`Insert` `>` `Table`](images/clipboard-112703173.png)
    1.  or you can use `Ctrl` + `t`
2.  you'll be asked to create a table - you should be able just to select `OK` </br> ![Create a table](images/clipboard-3913166740.png)

## A first table

-   congratulations, you should now have a 1-cell table on your worksheet </br>![a 1-cell table](images/clipboard-467996436.png)
-   think about this as a **container** for your data
    -   you could call it a **data structure** instead if you wanted to be more fancy

## Removing your table

1.  Tables aren't formatting - so you can't clear them like formatting
2.  Click inside your table, and you should see a new section of the ribbon menu - `Design` or `Table Design` depending on your version </br> ![`Design` or `Table Design` menu](images/clipboard-903977516.png)
3.  Select that `Table Design` section. The most useful parts are on the far left: </br> ![`Design` or `Table Design` menu](images/clipboard-1056500409.png)
4.  Select `Convert to Range` - your table should now return to being an ordinary cell
5.  Finally, please **re-table** your cell

## Grow and shrink tables

Let's add some new data:

1.  Please add three or four more dates, going back into last week, in the rows below your date
2.  Please add a word describing your main breakfast item in the next column
3.  Please add a third column, scoring that breakfast out of ten

## Grow and shrink tables
4. Now expand your table to include that new data. You can drag the blue handle </br>![Expand your table with the blue handle](images/clipboard-2487072995.png) or use the `Resize Table` tool in the ribbon menu </br> ![`Resize Table` tool in the ribbon menu](images/clipboard-1207705760.png). 
1. You can use the same methods to shrink a table

## Autofill and friends

1.  drag down to add two more empty rows
1.  select your three dates, and drag the **green** fill handle down into the empty cells </br>![drag the **green** fill handle down into the empty cells](images/clipboard-3445425412.png)
1.  this *should* populate the correct values - although you'll need to check carefully that everything has worked

## Filter and sort

Each of your column headers has a dropdown menu ![dropdown menu](images/clipboard-1297021923.png) that will allow you to sort and filter your table

- sort allows you to order your table by that column
- filters shows and hides rows of the table
- you'll have different filtering options for the different types of columns in your table

## Names and reference

- you can name each column. These work best as single descriptive words - `date` rather than `breakfast date`

    -   you might find it helpful to write longer names in snake case (`breakfast_date`) or camel case (`breakfastDate`)

    -   please now name your columns

-   you can also name the table as a whole. Again, that's done from the left-hand side of the `Table` menu </br> ![name tables from the left-hand side of the `Table` menu](images/clipboard-3100742867.png)

    -   please give your table an appropriate name

## Passing data demo

-   Your table can now be saved, developed further, or passed to other data tools
-   Tables have major advantages on this front:
    -   they're portable, so you can move a table around
    -   you can use **structured referencing** - like `=data[score]` - to select an entire column by name, which helps make Excel more robust
        -   see the intermediate Excel session on referencing
    -   you can send the data easily and safely to PivotTables, PowerQuery, PowerPivot, and other fancier data tools

## CONCLUSION: USE TABLES {.center}
