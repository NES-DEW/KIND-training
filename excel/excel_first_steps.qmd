This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd) (this session)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd)
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd)
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)		

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers a general overview of our beginner's skill tree:

## A brief overview of Excel

![Excel might be the cement of the universe](images/clipboard-965547330.png){width="60%"}

-   one of the oldest, and most widely used, pieces of desktop software
-   ubiquitous in business, finance, health and social care...
-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for
-   many versions

## But Excel is badly used, on the whole

+ [PHE lost 16k COVID19+ results](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/how-excel-may-have-caused-loss-of-16000-covid-tests-in-england)
+ [MI5 bugged 134 people they didn't mean to](https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2011/jul/01/mi5-data-collection-errors)
+ [JP Morgan 2012](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomgroenfeldt/2013/02/19/solutions-to-spreadsheet-risk-post-jpms-london-whale/) had a manually-updated spreadsheet
  - divided by sum, rather than average
  - massive losses, $2 - $6 billion??

## And most of us fall into Excel work...

+ most of us haven't had any data training
  + e.g. in KIND network (which is a very techy group) 75% didn't have a formal qualification
+ and the responsibility for doing that data work well falls on many of us
  + data work has become more prominent in lots of jobs
+ but good data work is really important...

## Good data helps...

-   answering which/when questions
-   seeing effects of changes
-   comparing different areas
-   looking at services over time
-   ...

## One word of warning before the practical part

-   there are lots of versions of Excel
-   they all work slightly differently
-   please don't panic if what you see looks slightly different from what I'm showing you
-   please ask if you're not happy/confident!

## Opening Excel (desktop)

+ find Excel in your Windows Start menu </br>![opening Excel on the Desktop](images/clipboard-1394052793.png)
+ you'll need to create a new blank workbook </br>
![Create a new blank workbook](images/clipboard-2150015829.png){height="200"}

## Opening Excel (web)

+ usually at [https://www.office.com/launch/excel](https://www.office.com/launch/excel)
+ you'll need to create a new blank workbook </br>

## Interface

![Excel interface](images/interface.png){width="90%"}

## Central idea

-   pieces of data are stored in cells
    -   one value, one cell
-   cells are arranged into rows and columns</br> ![cells are arranged in rows and columns](images/clipboard-1879510795.png){width="60%"}
-   arranging data like this allows us to analyse it
  - it's not just *Word on a grid*
  
## Save, close, open

![File menu](images/clipboard-3187630465.png){height="40%"} ![Save as](images/clipboard-1979369937.png){height="40%"}

-   save your new workbook
-   close it
-   re-open it (possibly from recent files)

## References

-   every cell in Excel has a **reference** - like its address
-   references look like this: `E7` <br> ![example references](images/cols.png){height="250"}
    -   `E` refers to a vertical column
    -   `7` to a horizontal row

## Data entry

-   let's add some data...
-   we can type into the cells </br> ![add data by typing into cells](images/clipboard-1771455666.png)
-   that data appears in the formula bar too

## An example: school holidays

-   Here are some [school holiday dates](https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2)
-   make three headings in row 1: `name`, `start_date`, `end_date` </br> ![add three headings in row 1](images/clipboard-1395187747.png)

## Values

-   let's add some values from the [school holiday dates](https://www.scotborders.gov.uk/schools-learning/term-holiday-closure-dates/2)
-   name of holiday
-   start date
-   end date
    -   dates usually go `DD/MM/YYYY` 
    - as we'll see, Excel does lots of helping when we enter dates...
    -   ...ðŸ˜±
-   we'll only need a few rows of data

::: notes
name start_date end_date Mid-term holidays 14/10/2024 18/10/2024 In service day 21/10/2024 21/10/2024 St Andrew's Day 02/12/2024 02/12/2024

## Tidy data

-   keep things consistent - spelling, case, formats, etc
    -   one piece of data per cell
    -   one instance per row (one school holiday per row)
    -   one variable per column (a column of names, one of start dates...)

## Tables

-   we can convert this group of cells into a proper **table**
-   click in one of your cells of data </br> ![Click a cell in your data](images/clipboard-1117112977.png)
-   `Insert` \> `Table` (or `Ctrl` + `T`) </br> ![Convert to table](images/clipboard-166790706.png)
-   click `OK`</br>![](images/clipboard-77557231.png)

## Lots of new things to see

![Table features](images/clipboard-1614882971.png)

## Autofill

-   we'll add a formula to calculate how long our holidays are
-   add a new column called `days`
-   paste `= 1 + (C2 - B2)` into the first cell of that new column
    -   and look out for our session on formulas...
-   double-click the green fill handle to fill the rest of the column </br> ![fill handle](images/clipboard-1731283483.png)

## Formatting

-   we can change the way that our spreadsheet looks
-   we can also change the way our values look

## Cell formatting

-   some examples </br> ![Formatting area](images/clipboard-4175540765.png)
    -   highlighting
    -   bold
    -   borders

## Number formatting

-   our dates are **number formatted**
-   Excel dates are actually numbers (like `45583`) formatted to look like dates
-   1900 dates!
-   percentages, Â£, ...

## Conditional formatting

-   we can also format based on values </br> ![Conditional formatting](images/clipboard-3358194074.png)
-   take care though - this can be both ugly, and inaccessible
