This is a session in our intermediate-level Excel skill builder course. This consists of five practical training sessions, designed to be taken together, that are aimed at helping users with some prior Excel experience build and consolidate their skills. The sessions are:

+ [Excel foundations 1](excel_foundations_01.qmd)
+ [Excel foundations 2](excel_foundations_02.qmd) 
+ [Lookups in Excel](lookups_in_excel.qmd) (this session)
+ [Excel programming](excel_programming.qmd)
+ [Pivot tables and pivot charts](pivot_tables_and_pivot_charts.qmd)

## Session outline

+ introduction to lookups
+ three methods for lookups
    + `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
    + `VLOOKUP()`
    + `XLOOKUP()`
+ partial matching

## Introducing lookups

What does a lookup do? Imagine that you have a table like this:</br>![Lookup table](../src/images/im_names.png)

A lookup would let us find someone's age from their name by:

1. taking that name from somewhere
2. finding out what row of the table that name is found in
3. and then returning the age from that row

## `INDEX()` and `MATCH()`

+ `MATCH()` takes a value, and finds what row it occurs in
+ `INDEX()` takes a row, and returns a value from it
+ older way of doing lookups
    + think *timeless classic* rather than *old banger*
+ simple and flexible
+ great way to understand and practice the logic of lookups

### `INDEX()`

+ `INDEX()` retrieves data from cells. You supply two arguments:
    + an array (range) of cells
    + a row number
+ `INDEX(A1:A10, 3)` gives you the third row of the range A1:A10
+ general syntax: `INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])`
    + `array` is the range we want to look in
    + `row_num` and the optional `column_num` is the number of the row (± column) that you want

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Find the `INDEX` worksheet of the [sample workbook](src/lookups_in_excel.xlsx)
1. We have a one-column table containing names in `A2:A11`
1. Use `INDEX()` to find the value in the third row

:::

![Index example](../src/images/03_index3.png)


### `MATCH()`
+ `MATCH()` retrieves the row number of a cell. You supply two arguments:
    + a lookup value
    + an array of cells
+ `MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])`



::: {.callout-warning}
+ the optional `match_type` argument is deathly important:
+ **1 (or omitted)** finds the largest value that is less than or equal to the lookup
+ **0**  finds the first value that is exactly equal to the lookup
+ **-1** finds the smallest value that is greater than or equal to the lookup
:::

### `MATCH()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `MATCH` worksheet
1. We have (the same) one-column table of names in `A2:A11`
1. Use `MATCH()` to find the row containing "Broward" - being careful to set **match_type** appropriately

:::



![Match example](../src/images/03_match.png){height="250"}


### `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`

+ given that match gives us the row number, and index takes a row number and returns a value, we can link them up nicely </br>![Index and match logic](../src/images/03_indemat.png)
+ first search through our data to find a `MATCH()`ing row
+ then use `INDEX()` to retrieve some other column from that row
+ the general syntax will be `=INDEX(range, MATCH("Name", range, 0))`


```{r}
#| include: false
# mermaid source
# flowchart LR
#   A[Lookup value] --> B(MATCH)
#   C[Array 1] --> B
#   B --> D[Row number]
#   D --> E[INDEX]
#   F[Array 2] --> E
#   E --> G[Result!]


```



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `INDEX + MATCH (1)` worksheet
1. We have a two column table, and we want a user to be able to supply a number in `E2`, and receive the appropriate word in `E3`
1. First, write an appropriate `MATCH()` formula to find the row matching the input
1. Next, write an `INDEX()` to take that `MATCH()` value and return the appropriate word
1. Finally, try joining both formulas together in one to give an `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
:::

![Index and match example](../src/images/03_indma.png)

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `INDEX + MATCH (2)` worksheet. We have several formulas about Eunika. Can you fix them to give the correct result?
:::


## `VLOOKUP()`
+ while `INDEX()` and `MATCH()` is great, it does produce some nasty-looking formulas
+ `VLOOKUP()` was introduces as a neater alternative - roughly `INDEX()` + `MATCH()` in one 
+ `VLOOKUP` returns along rows, allowing us to look up a value in one column, and returns a corresponding value from another column
+ that sounds ideal, but beware: `VLOOKUP()` is **much** more quirky and unreliable than `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
+ here's the syntax for `VLOOKUP()`:
  + `VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`
      + `lookup_value` is what we want to look up
      + `table_array` is the table that we're looking up in
      + `col_index_num` is the number of the column that we want to return from
      + `range_lookup` allows either approximate matching (the default) or exact matching (by specifying FALSE)
          + The major source of oddity. Make sure you [check the manual](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1) before doing anything serious with `VLOOKUP()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `VLOOKUP` worksheet
1. There are two requests for lookups. Can you populate them with appropriate `VLOOKUP()` formulas?
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
+ `VLOOKUP()` generally requires the lookup value to [appear in the left-most column of your range](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-correct-a-n-a-error-in-the-vlookup-function-e037d763-ffc3-4fae-a909-89c482d389b2)
+ as the second part of the task shows, this requirement can manifest in lots of odd ways
:::

## `XLOOKUP()`
+ semi-new (any versions after Excel 2019)
+ similar to `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`. Major differences:
    + it **spills**, so ideal for returning unpredictable quantities of cells
    + provides exact matching by default
+ the basic syntax is: `= XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array)`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `XLOOKUP (1)` worksheet
1. There are two requests for lookups. Can you populate them with appropriate XLOOKUP() formulas?

:::

### Returning several cells with `XLOOKUP()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `XLOOKUP (2)` worksheet
1. Set up an `XLOOKUP()` supplying a range of columns as the `return_array` value
:::

### Fighting with tables

+ note that returning several cells into a table often causes errors
+ you may need to work with a range instead if planning to use `XLOOKUP()` to return an unpredictable amount of data

  
## Partial text matching
 
+ Excel is not brilliant for partial text matching
+ there are a number of commercial add-ins and VBA-based solutions
    + those come with risks
    + we'll concentrate on base-Excel here
+ three main options:


1. `XLOOKUP()` with `match_mode = 2` + wildcard
1. `VLOOKUP()` with `range_lookup = FALSE` + wildcards
1. `MATCH()` with `match_type = 0` + wildcards

### `XLOOKUP()` with `match_mode = 2` + wildcard
+ `XLOOKUP()` allows partial matching via the "`*`" wildcard
+ add "`*`" to the end of the partial string you want to match
+ however, please be aware that:

1. this will only reliably match sub-strings at the start of strings
    1. (so "`ow*`" will match "`owl`" but not "`towel`")
    1. adding extra wildcards interacted unpredictably with `match_mode` in testing
    
+ `=XLOOKUP("*substring*", search col, return col, ,2)`

### `VLOOKUP()` with `range_lookup = FALSE` + wildcards
+ as with `XLOOKUP`, adding "`*`" allows wildcard matching
+ but you can do better with the **wildcard sandwich**: `"*substring*"`
    + or, if you're bringing in a reference `"*" & cell_ref & "*"`
+ ensure you set the (confusingly named) `range_lookup` argument to `FALSE` to allow approximate matching
+ `VLOOKUP("*substring*", table, column, FALSE)`


### `MATCH()` with `match_type = 0` + wildcards
+ same wildcard sandwich strategy, with the flexibility of `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
+ my preferred solution, largely because the other options are harder to debug
+ `=INDEX(array, MATCH("*substring*", array, 0))`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `Partial matching` worksheet
1. Try implementing these three ways of partial matching
