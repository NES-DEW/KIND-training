## Session outline

+ introduction to lookups
+ three methods for lookups
    + `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
    + `VLOOKUP()`
    + `XLOOKUP()`
+ partial matching

## Introducing lookups

What does a lookup do? Imagine that you have a table like this:</br>![Lookup table](images/im_names.png)

A lookup would let us find someone's age from their name by:

1. taking that name from somewhere
2. finding out what row of the table that name is found in
3. and then returning the age from that row

## `INDEX()` and `MATCH()`

+ `MATCH()` takes a value, and finds what row it occurs in
+ `INDEX()` takes a row, and returns a value from it
+ older way of doing lookups
    + think *timeless classic* rather than *old banger*
+ simple and flexible
+ great way to understand and practice the logic of lookups

### `INDEX()`

+ `INDEX()` retrieves data from cells. You supply two arguments:
    + an array (range) of cells
    + a row number
+ `INDEX(A1:A10, 3)` gives you the third row of the range A1:A10
+ general syntax: `INDEX(array, row_num, [column_num])`
    + `array` is the range we want to look in
    + `row_num` and the optional `column_num` is the number of the row (Â± column) that you want

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Find the `INDEX` worksheet of the [sample workbook](src/lookups_in_excel.xlsx)
1. We have a one-column table containing names in `A2:A11`
1. Use `INDEX()` to find the value in the third row

### `MATCH()`
+ `MATCH()` retrieves the row number of a cell. You supply two arguments:
    + a lookup value
    + an array of cells
+ `MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])`



::: {.callout-warning}
+ the optional `match_type` argument is deathly important:
+ **1 (or omitted)** finds the largest value that is less than or equal to the lookup
+ **0**  finds the first value that is exactly equal to the lookup
+ **-1** finds the smallest value that is greater than or equal to the lookup
:::

### `MATCH()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `MATCH` worksheet
1. We have (the same) one-column table of names in `A2:A11`
1. Use `MATCH()` to find the row containing "Broward" - being careful to set **match_type** appropriately

:::



![Match example](images/03_match.png){height="250"}


### `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`

+ given that match gives us the row number, and index takes a row number and returns a value, we can link them up nicely </br>![Index and match logic](images/03_indemat.png)
+ first search through our data to find a `MATCH()`ing row
+ then use `INDEX()` to retrieve some other column from that row
+ the general syntax will be `=INDEX(range, MATCH("Name", range, 0))`


```{r}
#| include: false
# mermaid source
# flowchart LR
#   A[Lookup value] --> B(MATCH)
#   C[Array 1] --> B
#   B --> D[Row number]
#   D --> E[INDEX]
#   F[Array 2] --> E
#   E --> G[Result!]


```



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `INDEX + MATCH (1)` worksheet
1. We have a two column table, and we want a user to be able to supply a number in `E2`, and receive the appropriate word in `E3`
1. First, write an appropriate `MATCH()` formula to find the row matching the input
1. Next, write an `INDEX()` to take that `MATCH()` value and return the appropriate word
1. Finally, try joining both formulas together in one to give an `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `INDEX + MATCH (2)` worksheet. We have several formulas about Eunika. Can you fix them to give the correct result?
:::


## `VLOOKUP()`
+ while `INDEX()` and `MATCH()` is great, it does produce some nasty-looking formulas
+ `VLOOKUP()` was introduces as a neater alternative - roughly `INDEX()` + `MATCH()` in one 
+ `VLOOKUP` returns along rows, allowing us to look up a value in one column, and returns a corresponding value from another column
+ that sounds ideal, but beware: `VLOOKUP()` is **much** more quirky and unreliable than `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
+ here's the syntax for `VLOOKUP()`:
  + `VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])`
      + `lookup_value` is what we want to look up
      + `table_array` is the table that we're looking up in
      + `col_index_num` is the number of the column that we want to return from
      + `range_lookup` allows either approximate matching (the default) or exact matching (by specifying FALSE)
          + The major source of oddity. Make sure you [check the manual](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1) before doing anything serious with `VLOOKUP()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `VLOOKUP` worksheet
1. There are two requests for lookups. Can you populate them with appropriate `VLOOKUP()` formulas?
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
+ `VLOOKUP()` generally requires the lookup value to [appear in the left-most column of your range](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-correct-a-n-a-error-in-the-vlookup-function-e037d763-ffc3-4fae-a909-89c482d389b2)
+ as the second part of the task shows, this requirement can manifest in lots of odd ways
:::

## `XLOOKUP()`
+ semi-new (any versions after Excel 2019)
+ similar to `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`. Major differences:
    + it **spills**, so ideal for returning unpredictable quantities of cells
    + provides exact matching by default
+ the basic syntax is: `= XLOOKUP(lookup_value, lookup_array, return_array)`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `XLOOKUP (1)` worksheet
1. There are two requests for lookups. Can you populate them with appropriate XLOOKUP() formulas?

:::

### Returning several cells with `XLOOKUP()`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `XLOOKUP (2)` worksheet
1. Set up an `XLOOKUP()` supplying a range of columns as the `return_array` value
:::

### Fighting with tables

+ note that returning several cells into a table often causes errors
+ you may need to work with a range instead if planning to use `XLOOKUP()` to return an unpredictable amount of data

  
## Partial text matching
 
+ Excel is not brilliant for partial text matching
+ there are a number of commercial add-ins and VBA-based solutions
    + those come with risks
    + we'll concentrate on base-Excel here
+ three main options:


1. `XLOOKUP()` with `match_mode = 2` + wildcard
1. `VLOOKUP()` with `range_lookup = FALSE` + wildcards
1. `MATCH()` with `match_type = 0` + wildcards

### `XLOOKUP()` with `match_mode = 2` + wildcard
+ `XLOOKUP()` allows partial matching via the "`*`" wildcard
+ add "`*`" to the end of the partial string you want to match
+ however, please be aware that:

1. this will only reliably match sub-strings at the start of strings
    1. (so "`ow*`" will match "`owl`" but not "`towel`")
    1. adding extra wildcards interacted unpredictably with `match_mode` in testing
    
+ `=XLOOKUP("*substring*", search col, return col, ,2)`

### `VLOOKUP()` with `range_lookup = FALSE` + wildcards
+ as with `XLOOKUP`, adding "`*`" allows wildcard matching
+ but you can do better with the **wildcard sandwich**: `"*substring*"`
    + or, if you're bringing in a reference `"*" & cell_ref & "*"`
+ ensure you set the (confusingly named) `range_lookup` argument to `FALSE` to allow approximate matching
+ `VLOOKUP("*substring*", table, column, FALSE)`


### `MATCH()` with `match_type = 0` + wildcards
+ same wildcard sandwich strategy, with the flexibility of `INDEX()` + `MATCH()`
+ my preferred solution, largely because the other options are harder to debug
+ `=INDEX(array, MATCH("*substring*", array, 0))`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Go to the `Partial matching` worksheet
1. Try implementing these three ways of partial matching
