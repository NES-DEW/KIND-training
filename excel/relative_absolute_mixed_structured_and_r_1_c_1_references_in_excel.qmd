## Welcome

+ this session is for ðŸŒ¶ðŸŒ¶ intermediate Excel users
+ you' need Excel of some sort to follow along
+ you'll also need the [exercise workbook](src/excel_references.xlsx)
+ if you can't access the chat, you might need to join our Teams channel: [tinyurl.com/kindnetwork](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3AQZ7-PbFVcziG2piHLt1_ifey3I2cwFL0yBuTSS8vVao1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=106d08f3-9026-40e2-b3c7-87cd87304d58&tenantId=10efe0bd-a030-4bca-809c-b5e6745e499a)

## Session outline
+ this is an intermediate-level review of referencing techniques in Excel
+ it's a technical session, so we'll concentrate on the how of referencing
+ A1 references
    + relative
    + absolute
    + mixed
+ structured references
+ R1C1

## A1 references

+ A1 references are the standard way that references are made in Excel
+ A1 references are usually made up of a letter and a number (like **A2**, **B56**, ...)
    + the letter stands for the column a cell is in
    + the number stands for the row
+ we can use those references in formulas
  + `=A1` will copy the values from A1 into the current cell
+ you can also use the `range operator` (`:`) to select several values - like `A1:A3`

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. using A1 references, can you populate the first three rows of the summary table in the `A1 referencing` sheet? </br>![](../src/images/ref_task.png)
    a. Start date
    b. End date
    c. First duty manager
1. you might need to switch off **Calculated Columns** from the floatie </br>![](../src/images/01_stop_calc.png)
:::

### Absolute vs relative references

+ by default, A1 references are **relative**
  + if the formula moves, the reference will change

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. try copy/pasting your three summary values:
    1. a few columns across
    1. a few rows down
1. what happens to your values?
:::

![The effect of moving our summary cells down the sheet](../src/images/refs.png){height="200"}

+ as you've seen, relative references can cause problems
+ you can change relative references to absolute (=fixed) references using `$`
  + `$A$1` refers to A1 **no matter what**
    + use this if you absolutely always want to refer to the same cell

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. update your relative references in the summary table to absolute references by adding `$` before both the column letter, and the row number
:::

::: {.callout-note}
+ if you click in the formula bar, `F4` toggles absolute/relative
:::

### Mixed references

+ `$A1` will be absolute in the column, but relative in the rows
+ `A$1` will be relative in the row, but absolute in the column
+ take care with these - they're pretty confusing (and we'll look at a much better way of doing the same thing below)


## Structured referencing
+ most objects in Excel can be named - including cells, tables, and ranges
+ structured referencing is a special case
    + `Table[Column]` syntax
    + shared across Power BI, PowerQuery...



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. please switch to the `Structured referencing` sheet
1. sum up each of the three service columns in the summary table
- `=SUM(SR_table[service_a])` / `=SUM(SR_table[service_b])` / `=SUM(SR_table[service_c])`
:::    
    
### Implicit intersection
+ you can convert a structured reference to a column to refer to a single value
+ that's done using the [**implicit intersection** operator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/implicit-intersection-operator-ce3be07b-0101-4450-a24e-c1c999be2b34) `[@col]`
    + (if you're using an older version of Excel, you might also see this written as `[@[Service_duration]]`)
+ if you pick reference locations with the mouse, this is how Excel will render your references



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. please try populating the `daily_total` by summing with implicit intersection
- `=SUM(SR_table[@[service_a]:[service_c]])`
:::   

## R1C1
+ R1C1 gives an alternative way of referring to cells
+ slightly more complicated, but more precise, and less confusing
+ largely encountered in VBA, but available and helpful in standard Excel

::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Switch to the `R1C1 referencing` sheet
1. switch to inspect formulas (`Ctrl` + backtick)
1. Have a look at the formula in the `First name` column
1. Now switch your workbook to R1C1 by `File` > `Options` > `Formulas` > `R1C1 reference style` </br>![](../src/images/04_r1c1.png)
:::

+ column letters (A, B, C,â€¦) are replaced by numbers
+ row numbers remain as row numbers
    + R1C1 = A1
    + R2C8 = H2



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. Have another look at the formula in the `First name` column - it should be much easier to conclude that this is the same formula in every row
:::

### Types of R1C1 referencing

+ three kinds of R1C1 reference:
    + absolute reference  = specify a row and column number (`R2C2`)
    + relative reference by adding a numeric offset in square brackets (`R2C[-6]`)
    + implicit intersection-like "give me this row's column 2" by using a bare R/C (`RC2`)
+ a much nicer way of doing mixed referencing



::: {.callout-tip title="Task"}
1. in R16C4, please populate the four rows of the `Age` column in the summary table using R1C1
:::


### Why bother with R1C1?
+ R1C1 adds a bit of complexity to simple formulas
  + but it makes complicated formulas (and repeated formulas) **much** easier to understand
  + this is a big help when working with more complex Excel documents - particularly if you're debugging something that's gone wrong
+ R1C1 gives the same formulas for the same work across different columns
  + we have to work this out by hand with A1 referencing - the row number would be different each time
  + this helps us understand quickly when and where a formula is repeated
+ (apparently) R1C1 is faster with very complex sheets
