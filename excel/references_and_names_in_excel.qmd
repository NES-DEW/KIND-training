This session is part of our Excel for beginners course. That's a series of six linked sessions, delivered on Teams, that give an introduction to Excel for people working in health and social care. The sessions are:

+ [Excel first steps](excel_first_steps.qmd)
+ [Tidy data in Excel](tidy_data_in_excel.qmd) 
+ [References and names in Excel](references_and_names_in_excel.qmd) (this session)
+ [Excel formatting](excel_formatting.qmd)
+ [Excel tables](excel_tables.qmd)
+ [Excel formulas](excel_formulas.qmd)		

Together, they aim to help you develop an appropriate set of Excel skills to help your work. This session covers references and names in Excel:

## Some sample data

| user   | DoB        | visit_date | service     |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Steve  | 12/11/1984 | 26/04/2024 | podiatry    |
| Emma   | 05/06/1999 | 24/05/2024 | respiratory |
| Bhavin | 11/04/1976 | 23/04/2024 | dietetics   |

## References

-   Excel sheets are made up of cells
-   cells are arranged in rows and columns
    -   columns have letters - like `C`
    -   rows have numbers - like `3`
-   references are the 'address' of a particular cell - like `C3`
    -   you can 'point' at a cell by using its reference

## Finding a reference

-   from the **name box**: </br> ![Name box](images/clipboard-1746127255.png)
-   or work out from the column and row labels
    -   always column letter, then row number
    -   **C3**, not **3C**

## Using a reference

-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell
-   formulas start with an `=`
-   so we'll use `= C3` to get Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)

## References in formulas

-   we use references to allow us to pass data around our spreadsheet
-   an example: how long ago was the service visit?
-   calculate the number of days since the last visit with `= C3 - TODAY()`

## References move

-   by default, Excel references are **relative**
-   when you move a reference, the cell that reference points to also moves </br> ![References are relative](images/clipboard-754991469.png){width="200"}
-   it is possible to 'fix' references
    -   we call these **absolute** references
    -   the `$` fixes a reference, so `$C$3` is absolute

## You can name things

-   almost everything in Excel can be named
-   the easy way to start with that is using the **name box**
-   names can replace references in formulas
-   this is valuable when things get more complicated

## You can use and manage names

-   via the **Name manager** (`Ctrl` + `F3`)
-   **Go to** (`F5`)

# Practical

## Using a reference

-   we can write a formula that copies the value from C3 into another cell

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
-   go to an empty cell, type `= C3`, and press `Enter/‚èé`
-   that cell should now have Emma's visit date (or whatever value you referenced)
:::

## References in formulas

-   how long ago was the service visit?

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   add a new column called last_visit
-   in cell `E2`, add the following formula: `= TODAY() - C2`
    -   that calculates the number of days since the last visit
    -   you may need to correct the formatting </br> ![correct the formatting if needed](images/clipboard-2200716982.png){height="200"}
-   then copy/fill down
:::

## References move

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   try copying your new block of last_visit cells around your sheet
-   their value should change
-   now try clicking those cells to see where the updated reference points to </br> ![where does the updated reference point to?](images/clipboard-754991469.png)
:::

## Absolute references

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   delete your copied blocks of cells from the last step
-   now update your references by adding `$` before the letter and number
    -   so `C2` becomes `$C$2`
    -   you might prefer to press `F4` instead
-   now copy and paste those blocks of cells again. What's different this time?
-   please delete those new blocks of cells when you're finished
:::

## You can name things

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   let's average the last_visit column
-   in a new cell (`G2` perhaps?) add this formula:
    -   `=AVERAGE(E2, E3, E4)`
-   now name that new cell `av_length` and try using it in a formula
    -   `= INT(av_length)` would round that to the nearest day
    -   `= E2 / av_length` would give you the percentage of average
:::

## You can manage those names

::: {.callout-tip appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   find the **Name manager** (or press `Ctrl` + `F3`) </br> ![Name manager](images/clipboard-3382288451.png)
-   try renaming your `av_length` cell
-   try making a new named **range** from your three `last_visit` cells
-   try using the `F5` Go to interface to navigate between your named cells
