## Welcome

-   this session is a non-technical overview designed for service leads

## Session outline

-   Why Excel, and why this session?
-   Strengths and weaknesses
-   Great Excel projects, dire Excel projects
-   Alternatives
-   Skill development

## Why Excel?
- 40+ years old
- initially developed as a finance tool
- uptake from financial areas outwards into other services
- likely circular reasoning: "we use Excel" because "we use Excel"...

## Why this session?
- now includes several different tools for working with data
- most of us only ever scratch the surface
- but it's really important to know roughly what's possible - and that's hard!

## Excel demo

- using [open Annual inpatient/daycase data](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/9e032286-e5bf-4eb0-837d-c0a05fe0d839/resource/32058e0a-0107-4035-891c-5c6a8571415a/download/inpatient_and_day_case_by_council_area_age_sex.csv)

## Strengths and weaknesses

-   great for one-off data projects, but Excel sheets often have a long life...
-   easy to start projects, but more involved analysis is messy
-   share-able and accessible - but many different versions of Excel, add-ins etc, mean that there is grit in the system
-   you can do almost anything in Excel, but you probably shouldn't

## Great Excel uses

-   simple, quick, one-off projects
-   using Power Query to manipulate data
-   using Excel to create/load data into Power BI

## Terrible Excel uses

-   replacing databases (complicated, but Access/SQL)
-   anything with free text (probably use R/Nvivo instead)
-   anything with many editors (use Forms or Sharepoint Lists instead)
-   anything with repetition and extensive manual editing (better Excel design needed)
-   very wide data (probably Excel redesign again)

## A cautionary tale

-   there are staff in Scotland's health and care sector who spend \~100% of their time manually editing Excel files
-   this is **almost certainly** the result of poor Excel practices
-   Excel is a complex product, with several routes to achieving end goals
-   and Excel can [malfunction to disasterous effect](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0f2cytq)

## Five top tips

+ keep data tidy (one value per cell, one row per thing, one column per measurement)
+ keep things as simple as possible - but not simpler
+ don't tolerate lots of manual spreadsheet work
+ take care with formatting and accessibility/reuse
+ bet that your spreadsheet will last longer, and travel further, than you think
