## Session outline

-   intro to logic in Excel
    -   five minutes of Boolean algebra
    -   basic logical functions (`NOT`, `AND`, `OR`)
    -   putting logical functions to work with `IF` and `IFS`
-   using logic in Excel
    -   dealing with errors and missing values (`IFERROR`, `IFNA`, and friends)
    -   managing different data types (`ISNUMBER` and friends)
    -   conditional summarising (`SUMIF`, `COUNTIFS`, and friends)
    -   nesting `IF` statements and future-proofing your work

## Boolean algebra

-   the standard way of working with truth-values
    -   found all over mathematics, logic, computer science...
-   think of a statement like `"my cat is blue"`
    -   call that `P` to save writing it every time
- assume that `P` is either completely `TRUE` or completely `FALSE`

## NOT

-   `NOT` gives us the opposite truth-value
-   if `P` is `FALSE`, then `NOT P` is `TRUE`
-   a useful shorthand: the **truth table**:



| P     | NOT P |
|-------|-------|
| TRUE  | FALSE |
| FALSE | TRUE  |

## AND

-   we also have functions to understand what happens when we're dealing with two statements
-   `AND` is a great example - it's `TRUE` when both the statements are `TRUE`

## XOR

-   For completeness, we should also talk about `XOR`
- `XOR` is `TRUE` when either of the statements - but not both - are `TRUE`

## `NOT` in Excel

-   sweet relief: please [open the sample workbook for this session](src/logic_in_excel.xlsx) in Excel
-   have a look at the `NOT` worksheet
    -   `NOT()` function inputs in the truth-table
    -   example use about inhalers
        -   note that `NOT()` will treat **any** number as `TRUE`, and 0 as `FALSE`

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   please add a formula to decide whether a person is a **non-user** of inhalers or not
-   it should return `TRUE`/`FALSE` based on the number of inhalers used
:::

## `AND` and `OR` in Excel

-   have a look at the `AND / OR` worksheet
    -   have a look at the truth-table for `AND` and `OR`
    -   specifically, look at the formulas and the way they use `AND()` and `OR()`

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   in the hypertension/diabetes table, you've got several rows of data where each represents a person. Please write two formulas:
    -   for diet and lifestyle, you'll want to return `TRUE` if a person has either hypertension and/or diabetes
    -   for statins, you'll want to return `TRUE` is a person has both hypertension and diabetes
:::

## IF

-   unfortunately our data usually doesn't come neatly coded into `TRUE` and `FALSE`
-   that mean we'll usually need to use our basic logical functions in combination with other functions
-   `IF` is a great example of a function that helps you convert to logical values
-   here's an example formula: `=IF(B3 > 150, "Hypertension", "No hypertension")`
    -   if the value in B3 is over 150, the formula returns `"Hypertension"`
    -   otherwise it returns `"No hypertension"`

-   this is useful in its own right, but gets even more powerful when you return logical values
- have a look at the top table on the `IF` worksheet

::: {.callout-note collapse="false" appearance="default" icon="true"}
## Task

-   in the `IF` worksheet, there's an incomplete table of blood pressure values
-   please write a formula to return `TRUE` if those values are over 150, and `FALSE` otherwise
-   there's a named cell on this sheet called `Cutoff` - please now change that 150 in your `IF` formula to use the value of the named cell
:::

## TRUE and FALSE are 1 and 0
+ many other tools let you add up `TRUE`/`FALSE` values as if they were 1s and 0s
+ this can be very useful - say, to quickly count matching values
+ Excel needs a minor workaround: add `--` before a logical value to treat it as a number: `=SUM(--Table1[Hypertension?])`

## IFS

-   `IFS` allows you to check for the presence of several conditions fairly concisely
-   an example: `=IFS(B4 = TRUE,"High",C4 = "CRD","High", D4 > 20,"High", TRUE,"Low")`
    -   read this horror as pairs of arguments, like `B4 = TRUE`, `"High"`
    - each pair contains
        -   a logical test - like `B4 = TRUE`
        -   a return value if that test is `TRUE` - like `"High"`
    -   the final pair of arguments are a catch-all to pick up all non-matched values
    
## Public service announcement

- just because you can, doesn't mean you should
- `IFS` get pathologically complicated
- pivot tables might be better for more complicated cases

## `IFNA`, `IFERROR`, and friends

-   these functions are great for dealing with errors and missing values
-   that's useful, because (understatement of the decade) Excel isn't very good at consistently dealing with errors and missing values

## `IS` and `IF` functions

-   `IS****` functions detect errors and missing values and return `TRUE`/`FALSE`
-   `IF****` functions detect, and then:
    -   if an error is found display a message of your choice
    -   otherwise just repeat the value they refer to

## What do they detect?

![](../src/images/clipboard-518981517.png)

## The important error messages ones

- BLANK = "There's no value in that cell"
- ERROR = "This formula doesn't work properly"
- #N/A = "[I can't find what I was asked to find](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/how-to-correct-a-n-a-error-a9708411-f82e-4e1b-8a7e-28c28311b993)"
- ERR = "A non-N/A error has happened"

## SUMIF and COUNTIF

+ basically, `IF` plus summary functions
+ three simple-ish examples to see:
  + `=SUMIF(B3:F3,">5")`, which totals all values in the range greater than 5
  + `=COUNTIF(A10:E10,"ramipril")`, which counts all occurrences of the work "ramipril" in a range
  + or the close relative `=COUNTIF(A10:E10,"*prazole")` which uses a wildcard to count all the words ending in "prazole" from a range
+ there's also the more complex `SUMIFS`, which allows you to sum with multiple conditions

## Example applications
+ `=IF(AND(B4 >= TIMEVALUE("08:30"), B4 <= TIMEVALUE("17:00")), "In hours", "Out of hours")` to determine if a time is in- or out-of-hours
+ `=IF(LEN(B20)=9,CONCATENATE("0",B20),TEXT(B20,"0"))` to re-add a dropped leading 0 from a CHI / ISBN
+ `=IF(ISBLANK(B26), "", B26)` to elegantly reference date values to avoid returning `00/01/1900` for missing values
+ `=IF((TODAY() > DATE(YEAR(B31) + 3, MONTH(B31), DAY(B31))), "Late", "Not late")` to determine if an activity has taken place in the past three years
+ `=FILTER(B35:B41, (C35:C41 > 4)*D35:D41>4)` to find all rows with a value more than 4 in both the C and D column
+ `=IF(COUNTIF(B44,"*ow*"),TRUE,FALSE)`. `IF` by itself doesn't allow wildcard matching, so you can attempt a work-around via `COUNTIF`
