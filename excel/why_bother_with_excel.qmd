## A brief overview of Excel

![](images/clipboard-965547330.png)

-   one of the oldest, and most widely used, pieces of desktop software
-   ubiquitous in business, finance, health and social care...
-   proprietary, closed-source, paid-for
-   many versions

## Central idea

![](images/clipboard-1879510795.png)</br>

+ pieces of data are stored in cells
    -   one value, one cell
- cells are arranged into rows and columns

+ arranging data like this allows us to analyse it
+ good data analysis helps make services better

## Data should help...
+ answering which/when questions
+ seeing effects of changes
+ comparing different areas
+ looking at services over time
+ ...

## Excel uses demo

+ re-arranging data with filters and sorting
+ formulas
+ lookups
+ summarising

## Five top tips

+ keep data tidy (one value per cell, one row per thing, one column per measurement)
+ keep things as simple as possible - but not simpler
+ don't tolerate lots of manual spreadsheet work
+ take care with formatting and accessibility/reuse
+ bet that your spreadsheet will last longer, and travel further, than you think
